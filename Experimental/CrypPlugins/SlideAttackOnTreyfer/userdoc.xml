  <introduction lang="en">
    Due to the simplicity of its key schedule, using the same 8 key bytes in each round, Treyfer was one of the first ciphers shown to be susceptible to a slide attack.
    This cryptanalysis, which is independent of the number of rounds and the choice of the S-box, requires 2^32 known plaintexts and the time complexity of 2^44 Treyfer encryptions.

  <usage lang="en">
    The slide attack on Treyfer in CrypTool 2 takes two character inputs of length 8 each.
    These inputs represent a slid pair. Searching for slid pairs is not included as part of the attack as this
    involves a huge number of inputs to be examined.
    Once the slid pair is provided, the attack performs its operations and retrieves the key in the output field.

  <usage lang="en">
    The plugin for performing a slide attack on Feistel takes two
    inputs: the plain text and the corresponding ciphertext which together
    are called "slid pair" if they are one-round encrypted.
    The slid pair can be any alphanumeric character (within ASCII range).
    When the plugin is run with proper inputs, it generates the unknown key as output.

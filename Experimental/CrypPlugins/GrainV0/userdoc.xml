    Grain v0 is a stream cipher which is based on two shift registers and a non-linear output function.
    The key size is 80 bits and the size of the initialization vector is 64 bits. 
  </introduction>
  <usage lang="en">
    After dragging the Grain v0 component onto your workspace, you will
    have to attach the two text input components to the connectors 'Key' and 'IV'. Also, you need to attach one "Number Input" component 
    which indicates the keystream length in bytes.
   
    After that, drag into the workspace one "Text Input" component where you should enter the plaintext and one "XOR" component that is going to be
    used to XOR the plaintext with the output of the cipher (keystream). The result of the XOR is the ciphertext.
    Additionally you have to connect a text output component to the 'Output' connector of the cipher, which is going to represent the keystream.

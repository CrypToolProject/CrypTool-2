<h2>Target point</h2>
<p>
    Please enter an arbitrary point in the vector space. This point may not 
    necessarily be a lattice point. Then press the button &quot;Find closest vector&quot;, to 
    find the nearest lattice point to this point. The problem to be solved in this 
    case is known as the <a href="help://CVP">Closest Vector Problem</a>.</p>

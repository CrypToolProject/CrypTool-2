<h2>Successive Minima</h2>
<p>
    The successive minima are the lengths of the reduced vectors. They are designated with &lambda; and ordered. 
    The first minimum &lambda;1 thus refers to the <a href="help://SVP">shortest vector</a> v1. Let the minima be defined as follows:</p>

<p>The definition can be understood as a sphere of radius r which "inflates" until it contains all n 
successive minima sorted by length.</p>
    
<p>The Hermite constant &gamma; allows an upper bound for a vector v with minimum length. Exact values ​​for &gamma; are 
    only known for the dimensions 1, 2, ... , 8 and 24. For the second dimension, it is about 1.26. 
    Using the Hermite constant one can construct a circle which contains the shortest vector (see graph below).
    To display this circle please enable the corresponding option in the settings.</p>

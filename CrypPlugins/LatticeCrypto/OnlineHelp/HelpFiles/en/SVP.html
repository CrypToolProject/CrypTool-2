<h2>Shortest Vector Problem (SVP)</h2>
<p>
    
The shortest vector problem is beside the 
    <a href="help://CVP">Closest Vector Problem</a> an&nbsp; interesting problem associated with lattices. One searches for a vector that belongs to a 
    lattice and has minimum length. That means there may not be another vector (except the zero vector), which is shorter.</p>

<h2>LLL algorithm</h2>
<p>
    Unlike the Gaussian algorithm, which operates in the 2-dimensional case, the LLL 
    algorithm outputs a <a href="help://SVP">shortest vector</a> in n-dimensional space. However, the 
    shortest vector is not always the shortest actually, but often a very short 
    vector. This restriction has the advantage that the algorithm works in 
    polynomial time, so a good solution can be found quickly.</p>
<p>
    
    Two important components of the algorithm are on the one hand the Gram-Schmidt 
    orthogonalization, which is generated for the given vectors mutually orthogonal 
    vectors that span the same vector space. On the other hand, this is the Lovász 
    condition with which the reduced form can be checked.</p>
    <p>In order to ensure that the reduced lattice still generates the same lattice as in 
        the beginning, only such transformations are performed, which form an unimodular 
        matrix. Unimodular means that the determinant is +1 or -1. This unimodular 
        transformation matrix can be found, in addition to the reduced base and their 
        <a href="help://SuccessiveMinima">successive minima</a> in the log.</p>

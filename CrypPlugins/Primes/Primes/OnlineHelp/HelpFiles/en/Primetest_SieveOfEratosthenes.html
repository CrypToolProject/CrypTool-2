<h2>Sieve of Eratosthenes</h2>

The sieve of Eratosthenes is a method for finding all prime numbers up to a given number.
To test if a given number is prime, one determines all primes smaller than the given number and
checks, if it is part of the list of the found primes. 
The method dates back on the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes of Cyrene (ca. 200 BC).<br /><br />
<b>Method:</b><br />
Take the list of all numbers 1 to n.
Start with the number 2. Cross out all multiples of 2 (excluding 2 itself) on the list.
Find the next number that is not crossed out. In this case, it's the 3. Cross out all multiples of 3 (excluding 3).
Repeat this with all numbers that are not yet crossed out, until you reach &radic;<b><i>n</i></b>.<br />
The dialog allows you to execute the method stepwise or automatically.
In the stepwise execution, you can proceed by clicking on the corresponding number.

<h2>Simpson's rule is used to calculate logarithmic integrals</h2>

<p align="justify">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_rule" target="_blank">Simpson's rule</a> is an "approximation method" for calculating an integral; this means that the calculated value does not correspond exactly with that of the integral. While this formula gives less accurate values than those calculated using Pari / GP will, the calculation is significantly faster.

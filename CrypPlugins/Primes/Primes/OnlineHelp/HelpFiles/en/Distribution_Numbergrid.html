<h2>Distribution of prime numbers in the number grid</h2>

<p align="justify">
The natural numbers are here displayed as a grid, and the "grid number" is shown.
Each box (square) in this grid represents a number. Prime numbers are shown as red squares.

<br /><br />The number of rows and columns of the numerical grid can be changed by typing in the text box or by dragging the lower left and right margins.
<br /><br />The buttons on the left allow you to scroll up and down. Click on the button with two arrows to scroll up or down two lines. Click on the other two buttons to scroll one line up or down.
<br /><br />
In the box "start value" enter the number you wish to specify as the first number in the grid.

<h2>Counting the number of prime numbers</h2>

In 300 BC, the Greek mathematician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid" target="_blank">Euclid</a> proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss" target="_blank">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a> was the first to try to estimate the
number of prime numbers up to a given number n.

With this dialog, you can evaluate three different functions that count the prime numbers in a given range.
Each of the three functions can be started, stopped and continued independently of the others.
<ul>
  <li>
  The function <a href="help://Graph_PiX">&pi;(n)</a> gives the exact number of prime numbers, that are smaller than or equal to n.
  The value <a href="help://Graph_PiX">&pi;(n)</a> is calculated by counting the prime numbers.
  </li>
</ul>
The two other functions are approximations that are based on Gauss:
<ul>
  <li>
    At the age of 15, Gauss offered a first approximation for the <a href="help://Graph_GaussPi">number of prime numbers</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
   He later improved on this with the <a href="help://Graph_LiN">logarithmic integral</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

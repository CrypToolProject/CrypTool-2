<ul>
<li>
<strong>Trial Division</strong>
<br />
To use Trial Division, call up the procedure and fill in variables before running. Execution will use a great deal of memory and processor time. We have set a maximum limit for this procedure; should a factor not be found after 100,000 iterations, the process will terminate automatically.

<h2>Pari/GP for the evaluation of the logarithmic integral</h2>

Pari/GP is an open source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system" target="_blank">computer algebra system (CAS)</a>,
that offers very fast implementations of arithmetic functions.<br />
It evaluates the logarithmic integral with much more precision than using Simpson's rule.<br />
Pari/GP can be downloaded from the <a href="http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/"target="_blank">webite of the University of Bordeaux</a>.
<br />
Activate the checkbox "Pari/GP" for using Pari for the evaluation of the logarithmic integral and select the program "gp.exe" in the file dialog. The program is in included the Pari/GP installation folder.
<br />
The <a href="http://www.CrypTool.org/images/ctp/documents/CrypToolScript-en.pdf" target="_blank">CrypTool script</a>
describes in chapter "3.13 Appendix: Visualization of the quantity of primes in higher ranges" functions for estimating the
number of primes in more detail, and how they can be calculated with the CAS Sage.
In the meantime, Pari/GP is part of Sage.

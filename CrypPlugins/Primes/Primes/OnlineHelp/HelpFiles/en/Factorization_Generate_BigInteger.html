<h2>Generation of a very large random number</h2>

This routine generates a random number with 100 decimal digits for use in factorization. The chosen method of factorization determines the duration and the resource consumption of the process. Reasonable restraints are provided; for example, since the trial division process requires large amounts of memory and processor time, if no factor has been found following 20,000 attempts, the process is aborted.

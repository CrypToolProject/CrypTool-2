<h2>Primitive roots of a prime number: entering values</h2>

You can calculate the primitive roots for multiple prime numbers by entering the primes in the following form:<br />
[prime1], [prime2], [prime3], ...
<br />
<br />
You can also calculate the primitive roots for all prime numbers in a range of numbers by entering the range in the form [number1]:[number2].<br />

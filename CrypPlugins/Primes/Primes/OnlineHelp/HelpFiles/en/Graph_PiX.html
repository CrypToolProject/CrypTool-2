<h2>The number of prime numbers</h2>

There is no known formula for calculating the number of prime numbers up to a given natural number <strong>n</strong>.
If you want to know how many prime numbers there are up to <strong>n</strong>, you have to essentially determine for each of the numbers up to n if they are prime numbers and count the primes. The function that counts the primes is called &pi;(n).
It is a step function, which can be seen in the visualization when using small interval sizes.

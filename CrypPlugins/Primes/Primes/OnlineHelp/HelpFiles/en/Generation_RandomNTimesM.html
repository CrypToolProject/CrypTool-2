<h2>Create random primes with m digits</h2>

This dialog allows you to generate a list of n prime numbers, each with m digits. In principle, the size of the prime numbers that a computer can generate is not bounded, but as it takes longer and longer as more digits are requested, the maximum number of digits is here limited to 500.

<h2>Ulam's spiral</h2>

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral" target="_blank">Ulam spiral</a> is a famous method of visualizing the prime numbers.
It was discovered by the mathematician Stanisław Ulam in 1963 during a boring presentation, when he started writing the natural numbers on a graphed paper in the shape of a spiral. He then marked all the prime numbers and to his surprise he found, that almost all of the prime numbers lay on
diagonals.<br />

This dialog draws the Ulam spiral. You can enter the interval of the displayed numbers and rotate and zoom the spiral with the two sliding controls.

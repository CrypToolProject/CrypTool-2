<h2>Create random primes</h2>

Prime numbers are used in many cryptographic algorithms. The RSA algorithm for example needs two very big prime numbers for the creation of a secure key pair.
These big prime numbers are usually created with the help of a random number generator.<br />

With this dialog you can generate a list of 10 random prime numbers with either 20, 50 or 100 digits, or even up to 500 digits by using the <a href="help://Generation_RandomNTimesM" >"n x m digits"</a> input field.

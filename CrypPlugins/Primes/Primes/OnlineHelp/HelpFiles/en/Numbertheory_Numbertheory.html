<h2>Number theory</h2>

<strong>Number theory</strong> is the branch of mathematics that is devoted to the study of integers. It plays a significant role in cryptology, because the security of many encryption methods depends on as yet unsolved number theoretical problems, for example the efficient factorization of big integers.

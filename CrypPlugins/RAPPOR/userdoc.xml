		Randomized Aggregatable Privacy-Preserving Ordinal Response, or RAPPOR for short, is a technology that is utilized to crowdsource statistics from the users of softare applications anonymously while ensuring stong privacy gurantees. This mechanism was first introduced in the paper "RAPPOR: Randomized Aggregatable Privacy-Preserving Ordinal Response" by Úlfar Erlingsson, Vasyl Pihur and Aleksandra Korolova in 2014 <ref id="RAPPORPaper" />.<newline />
		It adds the initial dataset of collected user data into a Bloom filter data strucutre <ref id="BloomFilterPaper" />. This Boolean array is then partly falsified through the application of the randomized response methodology <ref id="RandomizedResponsePaper" /> that is being applied twice in form of a permanent randomized response and multiple instantaneous randomized responses.  This process adds noise to the collected data, ensuring a calculatable level of differential privacy for the inidividual user included in the sample. <newline />
		It is a highly versatile and tunable mechanism that is, among other applications, used for the collection of statistics in the chrome browser.

			The RAPPOR component contains one <i>string</i> input option and one <i>string</i> output option. <newline />
			The input represents the initial data set that is to be processed by the RAPPOR mechanism. Every <i>string</i> input, sentences, words or single <i>chars</i>. is accepted. Every entry of the input string has to be seperated by a comma char ','. This has to be done so that a string array, with the ',' as the dividing <i>char</i> can be created.  It is highly recommended to use the RAPPOR plugin with an input, ordinarily a text input component, to be able to use the <i>Overview</i>, <i>Bloom Filter</i> and <i>Heat Maps</i> views to their full extend. <newline />
			The output represents the resulting steps of the RAPPOR mechanism. The first line of the output string is the Boolean array of the Bloom filter data structure after the initial data set of the input string has been added. The second line represents the Boolean array after the permanent randomized response has been applied. Every line after that represents one of the instantaneous randomized responses, the amount of that can be selected in the "Amount of IRR" entry of the components settings. By using the output with another component, ordinarily the text output component, the result of the RAPPOR mechanism can be used for further processing like statistical decoding.

				<b>Start</b> The start view is the first view that is displayed when opening up the presentation of the component. The start view serves as an introductionary slide for the component: presenting the title and abbreviation of the component while also displaying a short tutorial on how to use the component to its full extend. The start view does not present any data of the RAPPOR component nor is it reactive to user inputs in any way.
			</item>
			<item>
				<b>Overview</b>The overview view displays the Boolean array of the Bloom filter data structure in its initial state, once after being altered by the permanent randomized response and zero to multiple times after being altered by the instantaneous randomized responses. Every Boolean array is labeld as BF for Bloom filter, PRR for permanent randomized response or IRR for instantaneous randomized response on the left side of the view. Please note that a larger red entry in the Boolean array means that the cell of the array is set to true, where as a shorter black entry shows that the cell of the array is set to false.  An auxilary pink striped line is added from every true entry of the initial array of the Bloom filter, this enables the user to see the effect of the falsification of the randomized responses. The output of the component will be equivalent to the data displayed in this view.
				<newline />
				The user of the component is able to fully control the displayed data. The data that is being processed by the RAPPOR component into the Boolean Array is inserted through the input of the component.  The settings of the component are able to control all tunable aspects of the RAPPOR mechanism. By altering the <i>Amount of hash functions </i> option the amount of hash functions used by the Bloom filter data structure is changed. Altering the <i>Bloom Filter Size</i> option changes the size of all used Boolean arrays of the component. The <i>f percentage</i> option decides the amount of noise that is added by the permanent randomized response where as the <i>q percentage</i> and <i>p percentage</i> options control the amount of noise that is added by the instantaneous randomized response. The option <i>Amount of IRR</i> controls the amount of instantaneous randomized responses that are being displayed.

				<b>Bloom Filter</b> The Bloom filter view displays an animation of the process in that the Bloom filter data structure adds the initial dataset into its Boolean array. This view consists of a taskbar in the top, that allows the user to control the animation.  and the animation area below.  In the top left of the animation area the data set rectangle is placed. In this data set the input of the component is displayed. In the middle of the animation there is an arrow placed that shows the current input being processed.  In the top right of the animation the hash function rectangle is placed. This rectangle shows the calculated value by every hash function that is being used.  In the bottom of the animation area a visualization of the Boolean array from the Bloom filter data structure is placed.  Cells that are set to true are marked by large red lines where as cells that are set to false are marked by short black lines. In the process of the animation the cells that will be set from the current input will be marked by dynamic arrows from the hash functions rectangle to the cell of the Bloom filter that is being set.
				<newline />
				The animation is controlled by the taskbar in the top of the view. The user is able to control the speed of the animation by moving the slider. The maximum speed is 0.1 seconds per animation slide while the minimal speed is 5.0 seconds per animation slide. The start button starts the animation. The reset button resets the animation to its initial state. The pause button pauses the animation. Once the animation has been paused the button changes to the resume button. The resume button resumes the animation and changes the button back to the pause button. The previous button pauses the animation in case it was not paused and restores the previous slide. The next button pauses the animation, in case it was not paused and moves on to the next step of the animation.

				The user of the component is able to fully control the relevant data of the Bloom filter data structure. The data that is being processed by the RAPPOR component into the Boolean Array is inserted through the input of the component.  By altering the <i>Amount of hash functions </i> option the amount of hash functions used by the Bloom filter data structure is changed. Altering the <i>Bloom Filter Size</i> option changes the size of all used Boolean arrays of the component.
			</item>
			<item>
				<b>Randomized Response</b> The randomized response view enables the user to see all relevant information about the level of differential privacy provided by the RAPPOR mechanism. The view consists of a probability tree in the center surrounded by four rectangles containing relevant information about the levels of differential privacy provided through the randomized response methodology.  The probability tree shows the likelihood that an initial entry to the Bloom filter Boolean array will be falsified by one or both randomized responses. The formulas showing the transition from the Boolean array of the Bloom filter B to the Boolean array manipulated from the permanent randomized response B' and the transition from the Boolean array B' to the Boolean array S through the manipulation from the instantaneous randomized response are shown in the rectangle in the top left. The rectangle in the bottom left shows the values of <i>q*</i> and <i>p*</i>. <i>q*</i> is the probability that if a cell was set to true in the initial Bloom filter Boolean array it will also be set in the boolean array altered by the instantaneous randomized response. <i>p*</i> is the probability that even though cell was set to false in the initial Bloom filter Boolean array it will be set to true in the Boolean array altered by the instantaneous randomized response.  The top right rectangle shows the level of differential privacy "epsilon infinity" provided by the permanent randomized response. The bottom right rectangle shows the level of differential privacy "epsilon one" provided by the instantaneous randomized response.  To get more information about the concept of differential privacy consult the RAPPOR paper<ref id="RAPPORPaper" />.
				<newline />
				The level of differential privacy that is provided by the RAPPOR mechanism is dependen on the amount of hash functions used in the Bloom filter and the internal parameters of the randomized responses <i>f</i>, <i>q</i> and <i>p</i>.  These values can be changed in the settings of the component. The option <i>Amount of hash functions</i> contols the amount of hash functions that is being used by the Bloom filter data structure where as the <i>q percentage</i> and <i>p percentage</i> options control the amount of noise that is added by the instantaneous randomized response. Note that the level of differential privacy of <i>epsilon infinity</i> depends on the parameters <i>Amount of hash functions</i> and <i>f percentage </i> where as the level of differential privacy of <i>epsilon one</i> depends on all four parameters.

			</item>
			<item>
				<b> Heat Maps </b> The Heat maps view enables the user to see multiple iterations of the RAPPOR mechanism displayed as heatmaps. This visualizes the the effect that the randomized responses have on the initial Boolean array and makes the effect of the parameters <i>f</i>, <i>q</i> and <i>p</i> on the Boolean array easily identifiable. Furthermore it shows the difference between large amount of datasamples and small amount of data samples, especially for the instantaneous randomized response. The top rectangle of the view contains the Bloom filter Boolean array from that the heat maps are created. This Boolean array is equivalent to the Boolean arrays that can be found in the overview view of this component. Below are two heat maps created by counting the set cells of the Boolean array of the permanent and the instantaneous randomized response a specific amount of times.  The color of the lines, that represent the cells of the array, as well as their length show the amount of times the cell was countet as set. This value can be seen in the heat map legend on the left side of the view.  The heat map legend also contains the maximum amount a cell was set in the top, the minimum amount a cell was set in the bottom and the median amount a cell was set in the middle of the legend.
				<newline />
				The user of the component is able to fully control the displayed data. The data that is being processed by the RAPPOR component into the Boolean Array is inserted through the input of the component.  The settings of the component are able to control all tunable aspects of the RAPPOR mechanism. By altering the <i>Amount of hash functions </i> option the amount of hash functions used by the Bloom filter data structure is changed. Altering the <i>Bloom Filter Size</i> option changes the size of all used Boolean arrays of the component. The <i>f percentage</i> option decides the amount of noise that is added by the permanent randomized response where as the <i>q percentage</i> and <i>p percentage</i> options control the amount of noise that is added by the instantaneous randomized response. By changing the <i>Iterations</i> option the user is able to change the amount of times the permanent randomized response and the instantaneous ranomized response are created for the making of the heat maps.

				<b>Randomisierte Antwort</b> Die Ansicht "Randomisierte Antwort" ermöglicht es dem Benutzer, alle relevanten Informationen über den Grad der differenzierten Privatsphäre, die der RAPPOR-Mechanismus bietet, zu sehen. Die Ansicht besteht aus einem Wahrscheinlichkeitsbaum in der Mitte, der von vier Rechtecken umgeben ist, die relevante Informationen über den Grad des Datenschutzes enthalten, der durch die randomisierte Antwortmethode gewährleistet wird.  Der Wahrscheinlichkeitsbaum zeigt die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass ein anfänglicher Eintrag in das boolesche Bloom-Filter-Array durch eine oder beide zufälligen Antworten verfälscht wird. Die Formeln, die den Übergang vom Booleschen Array des Bloom-Filters B zum Booleschen Array, das durch die permanente randomisierte Antwort B' manipuliert wird, und den Übergang vom Booleschen Array B' zum Booleschen Array S durch die Manipulation der momentanen randomisierten Antwort zeigen, sind im Rechteck oben links dargestellt. Das Rechteck unten links zeigt die Werte von <i>q*</i> und <i>p*</i>. <i>q*</i> ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass eine Zelle, die im anfänglichen booleschen Array des Bloom-Filters auf "wahr" gesetzt wurde, auch im booleschen Array, das durch die augenblickliche randomisierte Antwort verändert wurde, gesetzt wird. <i>p*</i> ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass eine Zelle, die im ursprünglichen Bloom-Filter-Bolean-Array auf false gesetzt wurde, auch in dem durch die momentane randomisierte Antwort veränderten Booleschen Array auf true gesetzt wird.  Das obere rechte Rechteck zeigt den Grad der differentiellen Privatsphäre "epsilon unendlich", der durch die permanente zufällige Antwort bereitgestellt wird. Das untere rechte Rechteck zeigt den Grad der differentiellen Privatsphäre "epsilon eins", der durch die momentane zufällige Antwort bereitgestellt wird.  Weitere Informationen über das Konzept der differentiellen Privatsphäre finden Sie im RAPPOR-Papier<ref id="RAPPORPaper" />.
				<newline />
				Der Grad der differentiellen Privatsphäre, den der RAPPOR-Mechanismus bietet, hängt von der Anzahl der im Bloom-Filter verwendeten Hash-Funktionen und den internen Parametern der randomisierten Antworten <i>f</i>, <i>q</i> und <i>p</i> ab.  Diese Werte können in den Einstellungen der Komponente geändert werden. Die Option <i>Anzahl der Hash-Funktionen</i> steuert die Anzahl der Hash-Funktionen, die von der Bloom-Filter-Datenstruktur verwendet werden, während die Optionen <i>q-Prozent</i> und <i>p-Prozent</i> die Menge des Rauschens steuern, das durch die momentane randomisierte Antwort hinzugefügt wird. Man beachte, dass der Grad der differentiellen Privatsphäre von <i>Epsilon unendlich</i> von den Parametern <i>Anzahl der Hash-Funktionen</i> und <i>f Prozent</i> abhängt, während der Grad der differentiellen Privatsphäre von <i>Epsilon eins</i> von allen vier Parametern abhängt.

				<b> Heatmaps </b> Die Heatmaps-Ansicht ermöglicht es dem Benutzer, mehrere Iterationen des RAPPOR-Mechanismus als Heatmaps darzustellen. Dies visualisiert den Effekt, den die randomisierten Antworten auf das anfängliche boolesche Array haben und macht den Effekt der Parameter <i>f</i>, <i>q</i> und <i>p</i> auf das boolesche Array leicht identifizierbar. Außerdem zeigt es den Unterschied zwischen einer großen Anzahl von Datenproben und einer kleinen Anzahl von Datenproben, insbesondere für die momentane randomisierte Antwort. Das obere Rechteck der Ansicht enthält das boolesche Bloom-Filter-Array, aus dem die Heatmaps erstellt werden. Dieses boolesche Array ist äquivalent zu den booleschen Arrays, die in der Übersichtsansicht dieser Komponente zu finden sind. Nachfolgend sehen Sie zwei Heatmaps, die durch Zählen der Zellen des Booleschen Arrays der permanenten und der momentanen zufälligen Reaktion nach einer bestimmten Anzahl von Malen erstellt wurden.  Die Farbe der Linien, die die Zellen des Arrays darstellen, sowie ihre Länge zeigen, wie oft die Zelle als gesetzt gezählt wurde. Dieser Wert ist in der Heatmap-Legende auf der linken Seite der Ansicht zu sehen.  Die Heatmap-Legende enthält außerdem oben den maximalen Wert, den eine Zelle gesetzt wurde, unten den minimalen Wert und in der Mitte der Legende den mittleren Wert, den eine Zelle gesetzt wurde.

				Der Benutzer der Komponente hat die volle Kontrolle über die angezeigten Daten. Die Daten, die von der RAPPOR-Komponente in das Boolesche Array verarbeitet werden, werden über den Eingang der Komponente eingefügt.  Die Einstellungen der Komponente können alle einstellbaren Aspekte des RAPPOR-Mechanismus steuern. Durch Ändern der Option <i>Anzahl der Hash-Funktionen </i> wird die Anzahl der von der Bloom-Filter-Datenstruktur verwendeten Hash-Funktionen geändert. Durch die Änderung der Option <i>Bloom Filter Size</i> wird die Größe aller verwendeten booleschen Arrays der Komponente verändert. Die Option <i>f percentage</i> bestimmt die Menge des Rauschens, die durch die permanente Zufallsantwort hinzugefügt wird, während die Optionen <i>q percentage</i> und <i>p percentage</i> die Menge des Rauschens steuern, die durch die momentane Zufallsantwort hinzugefügt wird. Durch Ändern der Option <i>Iterationen</i> kann der Benutzer die Anzahl der Wiederholungen der permanenten randomisierten Antwort und der momentanen randomisierten Antwort für die Erstellung der Wärmekarten ändern.

    The CrypTool Workspace Manager (CWM) is – besides and even more than the Wizard and the Crypto Tutorials – the most important and central utility of CrypTool 2 (CT2). The CWM allows the user to create, edit and structure workspaces.
    <newline />
    Within the workspace the user can arrange different components in a kind of graphical, modular programming language editor. Therefore, the Workspace Manager provides a WIMP (windows, menus, icons, pointers) based user interface to organize and structure components on the workspace. Components are the foundations of CT2, because they are used within the other utilities (Wizard and CWM) and because they make it possible to combine and create different algorithms and to test and experiment with them, in order to improve the knowledge about cryptography of the user.
    <newline />
    To process and pass data from one component to another, the user can connect the components on the workspace, so that the user is capable to implement his own crypto algorithms and protocols.
    <newline />
    A new workspace can be created by pressing the workspace button in the dropdown menu of the "New" button in the File section of the "Home" ribbon tab, in the left upper edge of the CT2 menu, like shown in the picture.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/unbenannt.png" caption="Figure 1" /><newline /><newline />
    The state of a workspace can be saved in a file including all components, settings and connections. Therefore the state can  later be recalled again by pressing the "Open" button in the "File" section of the Home ribbon tab. Workspaces can also be printed or saved on disk as picture files, by pressing the "Print" button in the File section of the Home ribbon tab.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/unbenannt2.png" caption="Figure 2" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/unbenannt3.png" caption="Figure 3" /><newline /><newline />
    Components can be arranged on the whole workspace and they are represented in three ways: minimized, in windows mode and in fullscreen mode.
    <enum><item>
        Minimized, the component depicts as a minimal window, as shown in figure 2, that contains the icon of the component, the inputs and outputs as well as the "window control buttons" to maximize the component to a window, enter fullscreen mode and deletion of the component.
      </item><item>
        In window mode, the component shows a view of the component as shown in figure 3. Which view is to be shown can be chosen in a small toolbar in the upper left corner of the components window. When in window mode, the window size of the component can be changed by the user.
      </item><item>
        The fullscreen mode shows the actual view in the size of the entire space of the tab of the workspace as shown in figure 4.
      </item><item>
        Additional the CWM offers on the left a overview list of all components on the workspace to improve the velocity of switching between them.
      </item><item>
        If the workspace is in play mode, a progress bar at the bottom of each view illustrates the progress of the actual component. In case new messages occur, a notification in the progress bar displays them in the color of their type.
      </item></enum><newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/unbenannt4.png" caption="Figure 4" /><newline /><newline /><b>The four different views</b><newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/enigma1.png" caption="Figure 5" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/enigma2.png" caption="Figure 6" /><newline /><newline />
    Each component offers up to four different views: Presentation, Settings, Data, Log. <newline />
    These views can be distinguished according to their accountability between component developer set views, like the presentation and the settings (see figures 5 and 6), and the CWM set views, named Data and Log. The developer of the component is responsible for the content of the presentation and settings views. Note, that a presentation view need not be offered by all components and is individual for each component, while the other views are generated by default.
    <enum><item>
        The Data view represents the data that is present in the component, as in case of figure 7 a string.
      </item><item>
        The Log view stores and represents warning, error, info and debug notifications of the component (see figure 8). A click on the delete button removes all messages so far.
      </item><item>
        In window mode, the CWM offers a help button with which the user can directly access the documentation of the actual component.
      </item><item>
        The settings/parameters are the only views, that also can be shown in the parameters bar on the right of the workspace tab.
      </item></enum><newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/enigma4.png" caption="Figure 7" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/enigma3.png" caption="Figure 8" /><newline /><newline />
    All workspaces are arranged in the TAB BAR, right above the actual opened workspace.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Building a workspace</b><newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/suggestionlist.png" caption="Figure 9" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/textinout.png" caption="Figure 10" /><newline /><newline />
    In the menu on the left, the user can browse through the installed components of CT2 or alternatively use the search feature. The components are sorted in groups like Classical Ciphers, Steganography, Tools, etc., to enhance the browsing experience. Components may be added to the actual workspace by double-click or simple drag-and drop into the workspace. Components can be connected within the workspace through connections. These connections, represented in the workspace as black lines, could be created by holding the left mouse button on the input- or output of the starting component and releasing on the input- or output of the target component, which should be connected. In order to clear up the workspace, the parts of connections between two bends could be shifted lengthwise. Note that each component got input- and output connectors and that an output connector, symbolized by an away pointing arrow, can only be connected to an input connector, symbolized by an towards pointing arrow.  By pressing and holding the right mouse button, these arrows can be shifted around the component, in order to customize the workspace.
    The type of the inputs and outputs that should be connected have to be the same, or at least compatible. The CWM signals which inputs or outputs in the actual workspace are compatible by blinking and serves a pop-up when the cursor is over a possible target connector, whether the connector is of the same type, compatible or incompatible. In addition to this way to connect two components, the CWM offers a suggestion-list of components which may be connected. An example of a suggestion list can be seen in figure 9. By drawing a connection through holding the left mouse button from an input or output connector into empty space of the workspace and releasing the button, the list appears at the last position of the cursor and the user can choose a compatible component. The list is sorted by usage incidence of the components.

    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/playstop.png" caption="Figure 11" /><newline /><newline />

    The workspace can be controlled by the "Execute" ribbon in the main ribbon bar on top of the whole window. A workspace can be started by pressing the "Play" button, highlighted in figure 11, and stopped by pressing the "Stop" button. Starting a workspace causes the execution methods of the components in this workspace. A component executes only if data is present to all inputs, that are needed for the execution and is restarted when/if the data has changed. In order to guarantee a correct execution, please pay attention to the logs and read the documentation of the component. Every workspace has to be started separately. Note that several components need data input for their execution.

    <newline /><newline /><b>Organizing tools</b><newline /><newline />

    The CWM offers several tools to organize the workspace.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Zoom</b><newline /><newline />

    On the lower left corner of the workspace is the "Zoom Bar" (see figure 12). It is used to change the scale of the actual workplace. To automatically choose the scale to fit the whole workspace into the screen, the "fit-to-screen" button in the toolbar at the top center of the workspace is to be used. Alternatively the zoom can be changed by holding CTRL and scrolling with the mouse wheel. <newline /><newline />
    A left mouse button click on the percentage zoom level indicator readjusts the zoom level too 100%.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/zoom.png" caption="Figure 12" /><newline /><newline />
    Text Areas and Picture Box:<newline /><newline />
    Texts and pictures can be added to a workspace without the usage of additional components. The "text area box" button and the "picture box" button in figure 13 offer tools to create text areas and load pictures directly into the workspace. The boxes can be dragged and positioned like components. Editing tools for the text area appear on top of the workspace as a new toolbar, if the text area is focused. The size of the areas can be customized by the user through pressing and holding the downer right edge of the box. Note that the text area and picture boxes cannot interact with other components on the workspace and are always in the background of the workspace.
    <newline /><newline /><newline /><b>Component layout</b><newline /><newline />
    The components can be arbitrarily placed on the workspace by dragging them with the mouse, but it is difficult to obtain an exact placement of the components that way.
    Thus the CWM provides several functions that support exact component placement. These functions are accessible via the context menu that appears, when you right-click the mouse
    in the workspace:
    <newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/layouthelpers_en.png" caption="Figure 13" /><newline /><b>Alignment:</b>
    Select at least two components and call the context menu by right-clicking the mouse in the workspace. Choose one of the "Alignment" functions. If you choose for example "Align Right",
    all selected components will be moved so far to the right, that their right edges will coincide with the rightmost edge of all selected components.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Movement:</b>
    Select at least one component and call the context menu by right-clicking the mouse in the workspace. With the "Movement" functions, you can move all selected components at once by one pixel in the selected direction.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Spreading:</b>
    Select at least three components and call the context menu by right-clicking the mouse in the workspace. Choose one of the "Spreading" functions. If you choose for example "Spread Horizontal",
    the leftmost and the rightmost of the selected components will be fixed. The remaining selected components will then be moved horizontally in such a way, that the horizontal distances between them are all the same,
    while preserving their horizontal order.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Size adjustment:</b>
    Select at least two components and call the context menu by right-clicking the mouse in the workspace. With the "Size adjustment" functions, you can set the widths or the heights of all selected components to the same value at once.
    You can choose, whether the widths or the heights should be set to the smallest or the biggest value of all selected components.
    <newline /><newline />
    Please note that in the context menu only those functions are activated, for which the number of selected components allows a meaningful application of the function.
    Example: Aligning components is not possible, if only one component is selected. In that case, the alignment functions are deactivated.
    <newline /><newline />
    All layout functions can also be called with a keyboard shortcut. The shortcuts are displayed in the context menu.
    <newline /><newline /><newline /><b>Parameters</b><newline /><newline />
    For adjusting the settings of a component, the CWM offers the so called "Parameters Bar", like the one shown in figure 14, on the right side of the actual workspace tab. It can be fade in and out by pressing the button on top of the Bar, as well as re-sized in width. It displays the settings of the actually focused component, similar to the view: setting of the component window.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/parameters.png" caption="Figure 14" /><newline /><newline /><b>Embedded components</b><newline /><newline />
    With the target of development of more universal components, CT2 offers an interface, that is called "embedded component" in the CrypTool language.

    This interface makes it possible to extend components according to the modular design principle.

    The difference between a connection in the workspace over the connectors and an extension through the embedded component interface is, that in the embedded components interface one component may control the other. In CrypTool terminology, we talk about master- and slave components. The master (or main) component integrates the slave components, controls them and is allowed to access their functions. This is because master components can be dependent on functions of the slave component or an equivalent implementation on the workspace would be complicated.
    From the technical view, this approach reduces redundancy in the programming. Further components (i.e. KeySearcher) can be reused in various application possibilities (i.e. different encryption methods).
    <newline /><newline />
    Embedded components can be set by clicking the left mouse button on the bolt icon next to the window controls, as seen in figure 15. The components in the embedded component interface can be set and switched by clicking on the button underneath the component icons. They can be chosen from a vertical menu which lists up all components that support the defined interface, as can be seen in figure 16.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/thunderbolt.png" caption="Figure 15" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/thunderbolt2.png" caption="Figure 16" /><newline /><newline />
    The settings of components that are integrated through the embedded component interface can be set in separate tabs in the view: "settings" of the component that contains them.
    <newline /><newline />
    When creating a workspace and using a component which supports embedded components, the user should read the documentation of the component, in order to set the right embedded component components and settings. Note that several components need components in the embedded component interface.

    <newline /><newline /><newline /><newline /><b>Global settings</b><newline /><newline />
    In the "Main Settings Menu" of CT2 in the "Workspace" section can be set global settings for all workspaces.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Global progress bar, Checkbox:</b><newline />
    The selection of this checkbox affects the appearance of a progress bar after the start of a workspace, which represents the progression of all components within the workspace as a bar in the upper area of the workspace tabulator.
    <newline /><b>Show component connection proposition, Checkbox:</b><newline />
    By setting this checkbox, you can decided whether the list of connection suggestions should be displayed or not.
    <newline /><b>Component connection suggestion delay, Slider:</b><newline />
    With this slider, the time between holding the left mouse button and the event of showing the list of connection proposals can be varied.
    <newline /><b>Reset component connection statistics, Button:</b><newline />
    Pressing this button causes a reset of the statistics that is needed to create the connection suggestions. The statistics will then be recreated automatically according to the new usage of the components.
    <newline /><b>Standard appearance of components, Combo Box:</b><newline />
    Within this combo box can be selected whether components are always open by default (i.e. showing one of the four views), closed (i.e. in the smallest possible representation only the icon is to be displayed), or whether the components should make that decision by themselves.
    <newline /><b>GUI update interval, Slider:</b><newline />
    This slider determines how often the surface of the workspace and thus the representations of the components are to be updated. The time interval is specified in milliseconds.
    <newline /><b>Synchronous events, Checkbox:</b><newline />
    Sets the behavior of event handling of the execution engine.
    <newline /><b>Benchmark, Checkbox:</b><newline />
    If this checkbox is active, the execution engine benchmarks the executed functions.
    <newline /><b>Data type colors, Dropdown Menu:</b><newline />
    With these drop down menus the colors representing the different data types within the workspace can be changed.
    <newline /><b>Function colors, Dropdown Menu:</b><newline />
    With these drop down menus the colors representing the different functions within the workspace can be changed.
    <newline /><b>Reset colors, Button:</b><newline />
    Pressing this button resets the colors for the representation of data types and functions within the workspace to the default values.
    <newline /><b>Fonts, Dropdown Menu:</b><newline />
    In this menu can be selected the font type and size of all texts within the workspace, which invoke this option.

  <usage lang="zh-CN">CrypTool工作区管理器（CWM）是CrypTool 2（CT2）的最重要的核心工具，它不仅是向导和加密教程的补充，而且甚至更多。 CWM允许用户创建，编辑和构造工作区。在工作空间内，用户可以在一种图形化的模块化编程语言编辑器中安排不同的组件。因此，工作区管理器提供了基于WIMP（窗口，菜单，图标，指针）的用户界面，以组织和构造工作区上的组件。组件是CT2的基础，因为它们在其他实用程序（Wizard和CWM）中使用，并且因为它们使组合和创建不同的算法以及对其进行测试和实验成为可能，从而提高了有关密码学的知识。用户。为了处理数据并将数据从一个组件传递到另一个组件，用户可以在工作空间上连接这些组件，以便用户能够实现自己的加密算法和协议。可以通过按CT2菜单左上角的“主页”功能区选项卡的“文件”部分中“新建”按钮的下拉菜单中的工作空间按钮来创建新的工作空间，如图所示。工作空间的状态可以保存在文件中，包括所有组件，设置和连接。因此，以后可以通过按下“首页”功能区选项卡“文件”部分中的“打开”按钮再次调用该状态。通过按“主页”功能区选项卡“文件”部分中的“打印”按钮，也可以将工作区作为图片文件打印或保存在磁盘上。组件可以安排在整个工作区中，并以三种方式表示：最小化，Windows模式和全屏模式。最小化，该组件描绘为一个最小窗口，如图2所示，其中包含该组件的图标，输入和输出以及“窗口控制按钮”，以使该组件最大化到一个窗口，进入全屏模式并删除组件的。在窗口模式下，组件显示组件的视图，如图3所示。可以在组件窗口左上角的小工具栏中选择要显示的视图。在窗口模式下，用户可以更改组件的窗口大小。全屏模式以工作空间选项卡的整个空间的大小显示实际视图，如图4所示。另外，CWM在左侧提供了工作空间中所有组件的概览列表，以提高它们之间切换的速度。 。如果工作空间处于播放模式，则每个视图底部的进度条将说明实际组件的进度。如果出现新消息，进度栏中的通知将以其类型的颜色显示它们。四个不同的视图每个组件最多提供四个不同的视图：演示，设置，数据，日志。这些视图可以根据它们在组件开发人员设置视图（如表示形式和设置，请参见图5和6）以及CWM设置视图（称为数据和日志）之间的责任制加以区分。组件的开发人员负责演示和设置视图的内容。请注意，演示视图不必由所有组件提供，并且对于每个组件都是独立的，而其他视图是默认生成的。数据视图表示组件中存在的数据，在图7中为字符串。日志视图存储并表示组件的警告，错误，信息和调试通知（请参见图8）。单击删除按钮将删除到目前为止的所有消息。在窗口模式下，CWM提供一个帮助按钮，用户可以使用该按钮直接访问实际组件的文档。设置/参数是唯一的视图，也可以在工作区选项卡右侧的参数栏中显示。所有工作空间都排列在TAB BAR中，在实际打开的工作空间的正上方。建立工作区在左侧菜单中，用户可以浏览CT2的已安装组件，也可以使用搜索功能。这些组件按古典密码，隐写术，工具等分组，以增强浏览体验。可以通过双击或简单拖放将组件添加到实际工作空间中。可以通过连接在工作空间内连接组件。这些连接在工作区中用黑线表示，可以通过在启动组件的输入或输出上按住鼠标左键，然后在应连接的目标组件的输入或输出上释放，来创建这些连接。为了清理工作空间，两个弯头之间的连接部分可以沿长度方向移动。请注意，每个组件都有输入和输出连接器，并且输出连接器（由向左箭头表示）只能连接到输入连接器（由向左箭头表示）。通过按住鼠标右键，可以在组件周围移动这些箭头，以自定义工作区。应该连接的输入和输出的类型必须相同或至少兼容。实际工作空间中输入或输出的CWM信号通过闪烁来兼容，并且当光标悬停在可能的目标连接器上时，该弹出窗口会弹出（无论该连接器是相同类型，兼容还是不兼容）。除了通过这种方式连接两个组件之外，CWM还提供了可以连接的组件的建议列表。建议列表的示例如图9所示。通过按住鼠标左键从输入或输出连接器到工作区的空白区域并绘制一个连接并释放按钮，该列表出现在光标的最后一个位置用户可以选择兼容的组件。该列表按组件的使用率排序。可以通过整个窗口顶部主功能区栏中的“执行”功能区来控制工作区。可以通过按图11中突出显示的“播放”按钮来启动工作空间，并通过按“停止”按钮来停止工作空间。启动工作空间会导致该工作空间中组件的执行方法。仅当数据存在于执行所需的所有输入中时，组件才会执行，并且当/如果数据已更改，则组件将重新启动。为了确保正确执行，请注意日志并阅读组件的文档。每个工作区都必须单独启动。注意，几个组件需要数据输入才能执行。组织工具CWM提供了一些工具来组织工作区。缩放在工作区的左下角是“缩放栏”（参见图12）。它用于更改实际工作场所的规模。为了自动选择比例以使整个工作区适合屏幕，将使用工作区顶部中心工具栏中的“适合屏幕”按钮。另外，也可以通过按住CTRL并用鼠标滚轮滚动来更改缩放比例。鼠标左键单击百分比缩放级别指示符也将缩放级别重新调整为100％。文本区域和图片框：文本和图片可以添加到工作区中，而无需使用其他组件。图13中的“文本区域框”按钮和“图片框”按钮提供了创建文本区域并将图片直接加载到工作区中的工具。这些框可以像组件一样拖动和定位。如果文本区域已聚焦，则文本区域的编辑工具将作为新工具栏显示在工作区的顶部。用户可以通过按住盒子的右下边缘来自定义区域的大小。请注意，文本区域和图片框不能与工作空间上的其他组件交互，并且始终位于工作空间的背景中。组件布局可以通过用鼠标拖动组件来将它们随意放置在工作区上，但是很难以这种方式获得组件的确切位置。因此，CWM提供了多种功能来支持精确的组件放置。在工作区中右键单击鼠标时，可通过出现的上下文菜单访问这些功能：对齐：至少选择两个组件，然后在工作区中右键单击鼠标以调用上下文菜单。选择“对齐”功能之一。例如，如果选择“向右对齐”，则所有选定的组件将向右移动很远，以使其右侧边缘与所有选定组件的最右侧边缘重合。移动：至少选择一个组件，然后在工作区中右键单击鼠标以调用上下文菜单。使用“移动”功能，可以将所有选定的组件一次沿选定方向移动一个像素。传播：至少选择三个组件，然后通过在工作区中右键单击鼠标来调用上下文菜单。选择“传播”功能之一。如果选择“水平扩展”，则所选组件的最左侧和最右侧将被固定。然后，其余选定的组件将以这种方式水平移动，即它们之间的水平距离都相同，同时保留其水平顺序。大小调整：至少选择两个组件，然后通过右键单击工作区中的鼠标来调用上下文菜单。使用“尺寸调整”功能，可以一次将所有选定组件的宽度或高度设置为相同的值。您可以选择将宽度或高度设置为所有选定组件的最小值还是最大值。请注意，在上下文菜单中，仅激活了那些功能，对于这些功能，所选组件的数量允许有意义地应用该功能。示例：如果仅选择一个组件，则无法对齐组件。在这种情况下，将禁用对齐功能。也可以使用键盘快捷键来调用所有布局功能。快捷方式显示在上下文菜单中。参数为了调整组件的设置，CWM在实际工作区选项卡的右侧提供了所谓的“参数栏”，如图14所示。可以通过按面板顶部的按钮来淡入和淡出，以及调整宽度。它显示实际聚焦的组件的设置，类似于视图：组件窗口的设置。嵌入式组件为了开发更通用的组件，CT2提供了一个接口，在CrypTool语言中称为“嵌入式组件”。该接口可以根据模块化设计原理扩展组件。工作空间中连接器上方的连接与通过嵌入式组件接口的扩展之间的区别在于，在嵌入式组件接口中，一个组件可以控制另一个组件。在CrypTool术语中，我们讨论主从组件。主组件（或主组件）集成了从组件，对其进行控制并允许访问其功能。这是因为主组件可能依赖于从组件的功能，否则工作空间上的等效实现将变得很复杂。从技术角度来看，这种方法减少了编程中的冗余。其他组件（即KeySearcher）可以在各种应用程序可能性（即不同的加密方法）中重复使用。可以通过单击窗口控件旁边的螺栓图标上的鼠标左键来设置嵌入式组件，如图15所示。可以通过单击组件图标下方的按钮来设置和切换嵌入式组件界面中的组件。可以从垂直菜单中选择它们，该菜单列出了支持已定义接口的所有组件，如图16所示。通过嵌入式组件接口集成的组件设置可以在视图的单独选项卡中进行设置：“设置”。创建工作区并使用支持嵌入式组件的组件时，用户应阅读该组件的文档，以便设置正确的嵌入式组件组件和设置。请注意，嵌入式组件接口中有几个组件需要组件。全局设置在“工作区”部分的CT2的“主设置菜单”中，可以为所有工作区设置全局设置。全局进度条，复选框：在工作区开始后，此复选框的选择会影响进度条的外观，该进度条将工作区中所有组件的进度表示为工作区制表器上部区域中的条。显示组件连接提议，复选框：通过设置此复选框，您可以决定是否显示连接建议列表。组件连接建议延迟，滑块：使用此滑块，可以改变从按住鼠标左键到显示连接提议列表的时间。重置组件连接统计信息，按钮：按此按钮将重置创建连接建议所需的统计信息。然后将根据组件的新用法自动重新创建统计信息。组件的标准外观，组合框：在此组合框中可以选择组件是默认情况下始终始终打开（即显示四个视图之一），关闭还是始终关闭（即以最小的可能形式仅显示图标），还是组件是否应自行做出决定。 GUI更新间隔，滑块：此滑块确定工作空间的表面以及组件的表示要更新的频率。时间间隔以毫秒为单位。同步事件，复选框：设置执行引擎的事件处理行为。基准，复选框：如果此复选框处于活动状态，则执行引擎将对已执行的函数进行基准测试。数据类型颜色，下拉菜单：使用这些下拉菜单，可以更改代表工作空间中不同数据类型的颜色。功能颜色，下拉菜单：使用这些下拉菜单，可以更改代表工作空间中不同功能的颜色。重置颜色，按钮：按下该按钮会将工作空间中表示数据类型和功能的颜色重置为默认值。字体，下拉菜单：在此菜单中，可以选择工作区中所有文本的字体类型和大小，从而调用此选项。快捷键快捷键操作Ctrl + C：将选定的组件复制到剪贴板中Ctrl + V：将剪贴板中的组件插入到工作区中Ctrl + X：将工作区中的选定组件插入到剪贴板中Ctrl + Z：不执行上一个动作Ctrl + Y：重新执行上一个撤销actionCtrl +鼠标滚轮：更改滚动F11：显示/隐藏日志窗口和组件浏览器F12：显示/隐藏主功能栏Ctrl + A：选择所有组件Ctrl +右：右对齐所选组件Ctrl +左：左对齐所选组件Ctrl +上：顶部-对齐选定的组件Ctrl +向下：选定组件的底部对齐Ctrl + Shift +右：向右移动选定的组件Ctrl + Shift +左：向左移动选定的组件Ctrl + Shift +向上：向上移动选定的组件Ctrl + Shift +向下：向下移动选定的组件Ctrl + Shift + X：水平扩展所选组件Ctrl + Shift + Y：垂直扩展所选组件Ctrl + Shift + W：将所选组件的宽度增加到所选组合的最大宽度Ctrl + W：将所选组件的宽度减小到所选组件的最小宽度Ctrl + Shift + H：将所选组件的高度增大到所选组件的最大高度Ctrl + H：将所选组件的高度减小到所选组件的最小高度</usage>

    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/unbenannt2.png" caption="Abbildung 2" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/unbenannt3.png" caption="Abbildung 3" /><newline /><newline />
    Komponenten können im gesamten Arbeitsbereich platziert werden und werden dabei in drei verschiedenen Weisen dargestellt: minimiert, als Fenster und im Vollbild-Modus.
    <enum><item>
        Minimiert erscheint die Komponente lediglich als eine Art kleines Fenster, wie in Abbildung 2 zu sehen, das die Ikone der Komponente enthält, die Ein – und Ausgänge, sowie Steuerungsschaltflächen zum Erweitern des Fensters, zum Eintritt in den Vollbild-Modus und zum Entfernen der Komponente aus dem aktuellen Arbeitsbereich.
      </item><item>
        Zu einem Fenster vergrößert beinhaltet die Komponente eine von vier verschiedenen „Ansichten“ (engl.: views), wie in Abbildung 3 dargestellt. Welche Ansicht dargestellt werden soll kann in einer Werkzeugleiste in der linken oberen Ecke des Fensters ausgewählt werden. Im Fensterzustand kann die Fenstergröße vom Benutzer festgelegt werden. Ist der Arbeitsbereich im Ausführungsmodus, zeigt ein Fortschrittsbalken unterhalb jeder Komponente deren Fortschritt. Sollten neue Nachrichten verfügbar sein, erscheint in der Fortschrittsanzeige eine Benachrichtigung in der Farbe ihres Typs.
      </item><item>
        Im Vollbild-Modus wird die aktuelle Ansicht über den gesamten Bereich des Arbeitsbereiches dargestellt, wie in Abbildung 4 zu sehen ist. Auf der linken Seite bietet der CWM eine Liste aller Komponenten im Arbeitsbereich, um den Wechsel zwischen den Komponenten zu beschleunigen.
      </item></enum><newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/unbenannt4.png" caption="Abbildung 4" /><newline /><newline /><b>Vier verschiedene Ansichten</b><newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/enigma1.png" caption="Abbildung 5" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/enigma2.png" caption="Abbildung 6" /><newline /><newline />
    Jede Komponente bietet bis zu vier verschiedene „Ansichten“ an: Präsentation, Einstellungen, Daten, Log. <newline /><newline />
    Diese Ansichten können grob anhand ihres Inhaltes unterschieden werden. Der Entwickler kann den Inhalt von Präsentation und Einstellungen festlegen, welche in den Abbildungen 5 und 6 zu sehen sind, während der Inhalt von Daten und Log der CWM festgelegt. Für den Inhalt der Ansicht Präsentation und Einstellungen ist demnach der Entwickler der Komponente verantwortlich. Beachten Sie, dass die Präsentations-Ansicht nicht von jeder Komponente angeboten werden muss und die Darstellung individuell ist, während die Darstellung der anderen Ansichten statisch vom CWM erzeugt wird. In der Ansicht "Einstellungen" können alle Parameter der Komponente festgelegt werden. Die Daten-Ansicht stellt dar, welche Daten an der Komponente anliegen, wie im Falle von Abbildung 7 ein String. Die Log-Ansicht zeigt Warnungen, Fehler, Informationen oder Debug-Benachrichtigungen der Komponente, wie in Abbildung 8 zu sehen ist. Ein Klick auf die „Entfernen“- Schaltfläche entfernt alle bisherigen Nachrichten. <newline />
    Im Fenstermodus bietet der CWM eine „Hilfe“-Schaltfläche an, mit welcher der Benutzer direkt die Dokumentation der aktuellen Komponente aufrufen kann. Die Einstellungen sind die einzige Ansicht, welche auch in der Parameterleiste am rechten Bildrand des Arbeitsbereichs-Tabs angezeigt werden kann.

    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/enigma4.png" caption="Abbildung 7" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/enigma3.png" caption="Abbildung 8" /><newline /><newline />
    Alle Arbeitsbereiche werden in einer Tabulator-Leiste über dem aktuell geöffneten Arbeitsbereich organisiert.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Erstellen eines Arbeitsbereichs</b><newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/textinout.png" caption="Abbildung 9" /><newline /><newline />
    Im Menü am linken Bildrand kann der Benutzer durch die installierten Komponenten von CT2 stöbern, oder alternativ das Such-Werkzeug benutzen. Um dem Benutzer die Suche nach der richtigen Komponente zu vereinfachen, sind die Komponenten geordnet nach Gruppen wie klassische Chiffren, Steganographie, Werkzeuge, usw. Komponenten können dann per Doppelklick oder einfachem Drag-und-Drop dem aktuellen Arbeitsbereich hinzugefügt werden. Innerhalb des Arbeitsbereiches können Komponenten verbunden werden. Diese Verbindungen, im Arbeitsbereich dargestellt durch schwarze Linien, können durch Halten der linken Maustaste auf dem Ein- oder Ausgang der Ausgangs-Komponente und Loslassen auf dem Aus- oder Eingang der Ziel-Komponente durch den Benutzer erstellt werden. Um den Arbeitsbereich übersichtlich zu halten, können die Teile der Verbindungen, welche sich zwischen zwei Abzweigungen befinden, durch Halten der linken Maustaste und Ziehen längsseits verschoben werden. Jede Komponente besitzt Ein- und/oder Ausgänge. Eingänge können nur mit Ausgängen, sowie Ausgänge nur mit Eingängen verbunden werden. Eingänge werden durch zur Komponente hinzeigende Pfeile und Ausgänge durch weg zeigende Pfeilsymbole dargestellt. Diese Pfeilsymbole können durch Drücken und Halten der rechten Maustaste vom Benutzer vollständig rings um die Darstellung der Komponente herum positioniert werden, um den Arbeitsbereich weiter anzupassen.
    <newline />
    Bitte beachten Sie, dass der Typ der zu verbindenden Ein- und Ausgänge stets derselbe oder wenigstens kompatibel sein muss. Der CWM signalisiert durch Blinken, welche Ein- und Ausgaben des aktuellen Arbeitsbereiches kompatibel sind und zeigt in einem Einblend-Menü, wenn sich der Mauszeiger über dem zu verbindenden Konnektor befindet, ob der Konnektor vom selben Typ, kompatibel oder inkompatibel ist. Zusätzlich zu dieser Art, Komponenten zu verbinden, bietet der CWM eine Vorschlagsliste an, welche Komponenten verbunden werden können. Ein Beispiel für solch eine Vorschlagsliste ist in Abbildung 10 zu sehen. Durch Zeichnen einer Verbindung, angefangen von einem Ein- oder Ausgabe-Konnektor hinein in den freien Raum des Arbeitsbereiches, und Loslassen der Maustaste, erscheint die Liste an der letzten Position des Mauszeigers und der Benutzer kann eine kompatible Komponente aus dieser Liste wählen. Die Sortierung der Liste richtet sich absteigend nach der Häufigkeit der Benutzung der Komponenten durch den Benutzer.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/suggestionlist.png" caption="Abbildung 10" /><newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/playstop.png" caption="Abbildung 11" /><newline /><newline />

    Der Arbeitsbereich kann mit Hilfe des „Ausführen“-Ribbons in der Haupt-Ribbon-Bar im oberen Abschnitt des gesamten Fensters kontrolliert werden. Arbeitsbereiche können durch Drücken der „Starten“-Schaltfläche, zu sehen in Abbildung 11, gestartet und durch Drücken der „Stoppen“-Schaltfläche angehalten werden. Eine Komponente wird nur dann ausgeführt, wenn an allen Eingängen Daten anliegen, die für die Ausführung notwendig sind. Hier sei auf die Dokumentation der jeweiligen Komponente verwiesen, um eine korrekte Ausführung sicher zu stellen, und darauf, dass auf eventuelle Benachrichtigungen in der Log-Rubrik der Komponente zu achten ist. Jeder Arbeitsbereich muss einzeln gestartet werden. Es sei noch einmal erwähnt, dass viele Komponenten Eingaben für ihre Ausführung zwingend benötigen.


    <newline /><newline /><b>Organisationswerkzeuge </b><newline /><newline />

    Der CWM bietet verschiedene Werkzeuge zur Organisation der Arbeitsbereiche an.

    <newline /><newline /><b>Zoom </b><newline /><newline />

    In der unteren linken Ecke befindet sich die „Zoom-Leiste“, die in etwa so aussehen sollte wie in Abbildung 12 zu sehen. Sie dient dazu, den Maßstab des aktuellen Arbeitsbereiches zu variieren. Um den Maßstab automatisch so anzupassen, dass der gesamte Arbeitsbereich zu sehen ist, sollte die Schaltfläche „Fit-to-screen“ (das Symbol dazu ist in der Mitte oberhalb des Arbeitsbereiches) verwendet werden. Alternativ kann zum Zoomen auch das Maus-Rad benutzt werden, wenn beim Rollen die Strg-Taste gehalten wird. Ein Klick mit der linken Maustaste auf die Prozent-Angabe der Zoom-Leiste, setzt diese auf 100%.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/zoom.png" caption="Abbildung 12" /><newline /><newline /><b>Layout der Komponenten</b><newline /><newline />
    Die Komponenten können mit der Maus beliebig auf dem Arbeitsbereich verschoben werden. Allerdings ist es schwierig, auf diese Art die Komponenten exakt zu platzieren.
    Daher stellt der CWM einige Funktionen zur Verfügung, die ein exaktes Layout der Komponenten ermöglichen. Diese Funktionen sind über das Kontextmenü aufrufbar, das erscheint, wenn Sie
    im Arbeitsbereich die rechte Maustaste drücken:
    <newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/layouthelpers_de.png" caption="Abbildung 13" /><newline /><b>Ausrichten:</b>
    Wählen Sie mindestens zwei Komponenten aus und rufen dann das Kontextmenü durch Rechtsklick im Arbeitsbereich auf. Wählen Sie eine der Ausrichten-Funktionen. Wenn Sie z.B. "Rechts ausrichten" wählen,
    werden alle ausgewählten Komponenten horizontal so weit nach rechts verschoben, dass ihre rechte Kante mit der am weitesten rechts liegenden rechten Kante aller ausgewählten Komponenten übereinstimmt.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Verschieben:</b>
    Wählen Sie mindestens eine Komponente aus und rufen dann das Kontextmenü durch Rechtsklick im Arbeitsbereich auf. Mit den Verschiebe-Funktionen können Sie alle ausgewählten Komponenten gleichzeitig um eine Pixelbreite in die
    ausgewählte Richtung verschieben.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Verteilen:</b>
    Wählen Sie mindestens drei Komponenten aus und rufen dann das Kontextmenü durch Rechtsklick im Arbeitsbereich auf. Wählen Sie eine der Verteil-Funktionen. Wenn Sie z.B. "Horizontal verteilen" wählen,
    werden die am weitesten links und rechts liegenden der ausgewählten Komponenten bestimmt und fixiert. Die restlichen ausgewählten Komponenten werden dann (unter Beibehaltung der Reihenfolge) horizontal so verschoben,
    dass ihre horizontalen Abstände voneinander alle gleich sind.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Größenanpassung:</b>
    Wählen Sie mindestens zwei Komponenten aus und rufen dann das Kontextmenü durch Rechtsklick im Arbeitsbereich auf. Mit den Größenanpassungs-Funktionen können Sie die Breiten oder Höhen aller ausgewählten Komponenten gleichzeitig auf den
    selben Wert setzen. Sie können dabei wählen, ob die Breiten oder Höhen der Komponenten auf den größten oder kleinsten Wert unter den ausgewählten Komponenten gesetzt werden soll.
    <newline /><newline />
    Bitte beachten Sie, dass eine Funktion im Kontext-Menü nur dann aktiviert ist, wenn sie für die Anzahl der ausgewählten Komponenten sinnvoll ist. Es ist beispielsweise kein Ausrichten von Komponenten möglich, wenn nur eine Komponente
    ausgewählt wurde. In diesem Fall sind die Ausrichten-Funktionen deaktiviert.
    <newline /><newline />
    Alle Layout-Funktionen sind auch über Tastaturkürzel aufrufbar. Die zu den einzelnen Funktionen gehörigen Tastaturkürzel werden im Kontextmenü angezeigt.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Textfeld und Bilderfeld</b><newline /><newline />
    Texte und Bilder können – ohne von einer weiteren Komponente Gebrauch zu machen – direkt dem Arbeitsbereich hinzugefügt werden. Die Textfeld-Schaltfläche und die Bildfeld-Schaltfläche bieten, wie in Abbildung 13 zu sehen, Werkzeuge, um Texte zu erzeugen und Bilder direkt in den Hintergrund des Arbeitsbereiches zu laden. Beide Bereiche können im Arbeitsbereich verschoben werden wie Komponenten. Wenn das Textfeld fokussiert ist, erscheint oberhalb des Arbeitsbereiches eine Werkzeugleiste zur Formatierung des Textes. Die Größe des Bereichs kann durch Halten und Ziehen der unteren rechten Ecke des Textfeldes verändert werden. Diese beiden Werkzeuge können nicht mit den normalen Komponenten interagieren und bleiben stets im Hintergrund des Arbeitsbereiches. Man kann Textfelder benutzen für Memos oder für kurze Beschreibungen, was man mit dem aktuellen Workspace machen kann. Mit den Bildfelder kann man rein optisch auch Komponenten gruppieren.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Parameter-Leiste</b><newline /><newline />
    Zum Justieren der Einstellungen von Komponenten bietet der CWM auf der rechten Seite des aktuellen Arbeitsbereiches die so genannte "Parameter-Leiste" an (siehe Abbildung 14). Diese kann sowohl ein- als auch ausgeblendet werden (mit Hilfe der Schaltfläche oberhalb der Leiste), so wie in der Breite verändert werden. Ihr Inhalt entspricht der Einstellungsansicht der Komponente, die gerade den Fokus hat.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/parameters.png" caption="Abbildung 14" /><newline /><newline /><b> Integrierte Komponenten </b><newline /><newline />
    Mit dem Ziel, Komponenten möglichst universell gestalten zu können, bietet CT2 eine Schnittstelle an, welche in der CrypTool Sprache "integrierte Komponenten" genannt wird.

    Diese Schnittstelle macht es möglich, Komponenten modular nach dem Baukastenprinzip durch andere Komponenten zu erweitern.

    Der Unterschied zwischen einer Verbindung im Arbeitsbereich, über die Konnektoren und einer Erweiterung durch die Schnittstelle für integrierte Komponenten, besteht darin, dass eine Komponente die andere steuern kann. Hierbei wird von Master- und Slave-Komponenten (engl. für Meister und Knecht) gesprochen. Die Master-Komponente ist dabei die Hauptkomponente, die die Slave-Komponente einbindet, steuert und auf deren Funktionen zugreifen kann. Der Hintergrund ist der, dass die Master-Komponente beispielsweise auf Funktionen der Slave-Komponente angewiesen ist, oder aber auch dass eine äquivalente Implementierung über den Arbeitsbereich kompliziert wäre.
    Technisch gesehen reduziert dies Redundanzen bei der Programmierung und macht Komponenten (wie z.B. den KeySearcher) für verschiedene Einsatzmöglichkeiten (z.B. verschiedene Verschlüsselungsverfahren) wiederverwendbar.
    <newline /><newline />
    Unterstützt eine Komponente die Funktionalität für integrierte Komponenten, befindet sich neben den normalen Fenster-Kontrollelementen ein Blitzsymbol, wie in Abbildung 15 zu sehen. Die Komponenten können durch Anklicken der Schaltfläche unterhalb der Ikonen eingesetzt und getauscht werden. Ein vertikales Auswahl-Menü listet alle Komponenten auf, welche die definierte integrierte Komponenten-Schnittstelle unterstützen: siehe Abbildung 16.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/thunderbolt.png" caption="Abbildung 15" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/thunderbolt2.png" caption="Abbildung 16" /><newline /><newline />
    Die Einstellungen der eingebundenen Komponenten erscheinen in eigenen Reitern, in der Ansicht "Einstellungen" der Komponente, die sie einbindet.
    <newline /><newline />
    Beim Erstellen eines Arbeitsbereiches mit Komponenten, die integrierte Komponenten unterstützen, sollten Sie als Benutzer sorgfältig die Dokumentation der Komponente lesen, um die richtigen Komponenten und Einstellungen zu wählen. Manche Komponenten benötigen zur Ausführung zwingend Komponenten für die integrierte Komponenten-Schnittstelle.

    <newline /><newline /><newline /><newline /><b>Globale Einstellungen</b><newline /><newline />
    In den "Haupteinstellungen" von CT2 im Abschnitt "Arbeitsbereich" können globale Einstellungen für alle Arbeitsbereiche festgelegt werden.
    <newline /><newline /><b>  Globaler Fortschrittsbalken, Kontrollkästchen:</b><newline /><newline />
    Das Setzen dieses Kontrollkästchens bewirkt, dass nach dem Start eines Arbeitsbereiches eine Fortschrittsanzeige oberhalb des Tabulatorfensters erscheint, welche den Verlauf des Arbeitsbereichs als Balken darstellt.
    <newline /><newline /><b>  Zeige Komponenten-Verbindungsvorschläge, Kontrollkästchen:</b><newline /><newline />
    Mit dem Setzen dieses Kontrollkästchens kann entschieden werden, ob die Liste mit Verbindungsvorschlägen angezeigt werden soll oder nicht.
    <newline /><newline /><b> Verzögerung des Komponenten-Verbindungsvorschlags, Schieber:</b><newline /><newline />
    Mit Hilfe dieses Schiebereglers kann die Zeit zwischen Halten und Anzeigen der Liste mit Verbindungsvorschlägen variiert werden.
    <newline /><newline /><b>  Komponenten-Konnektoren-Statistik zurücksetzen, Schaltfläche:</b><newline /><newline />
    Das Drücken dieser Schaltfläche bewirkt ein Zurücksetzen der Statistik, die zur Erstellung der Verbindungsvorschläge nötig ist. Die Statistik wird danach automatisch gemäß der Benutzung neu erstellt.
    <newline /><newline /><b>  Standardmäßige Darstellung von Komponenten, Auswahlfeld:</b><newline /><newline />
    In diesem Auswahlfeld kann gewählt werden, ob Komponenten standardmäßig geöffnet (also unter Darstellung einer der vier Ansichten) oder geschlossen (also in der kleinstmöglichen Repräsentation, bei der nur das Icon der Komponente angezeigt wird) dargestellt werden sollen, oder ob die Komponente diese Entscheidung selbst treffen soll.
    <newline /><newline /><b>  GUI Update-Intervall, Schieberegler:</b><newline /><newline />
    Mit diesem Schieberegler kann bestimmt werden, wie oft die Oberfläche des Arbeitsbereichs und damit auch die Darstellungen der Komponenten aktualisiert werden sollen. Die Intervalldauer wird in Millisekunden angegeben.
    <newline /><newline /><b>  Synchrone Ereignisse, Kontrollkästchen:</b><newline /><newline />
    Wählt die Art der Ereignisbehandlung der Ausführungsmaschine
    <newline /><newline /><b>   Benchmark, Kontrollkästchen:</b><newline /><newline />
    In diesem Kontrollkästchen kann eingestellt werden, ob die Ausführungsmaschine die aufgerufenen Funktionen auf Sekundenbasis evaluieren soll oder nicht.
    <newline /><newline /><b>  Datentyp-Farben, Dropdown Menu:</b><newline /><newline />
    In diesen Dropdown-Menüs kann eingestellt werden, in welchen Farben die verschiedenen Datentypen innerhalb des Arbeitsbereiches dargestellt werden.
    <newline /><newline /><b>   Funktionen-Farben, Dropdown Menu:</b><newline /><newline />
    In diesen Dropdown-Menüs kann eingestellt werden, in welchen Farben die verschiedenen Funktionen innerhalb des Arbeitsbereiches dargestellt werden.
    <newline /><newline /><b>   Farben zurücksetzen, Schaltfläche:</b><newline /><newline />
    Das Drücken dieser Schaltfläche bewirkt ein Zurücksetzen der Farben für die Darstellung von Datentypen und Funktionen innerhalb des Arbeitsbereichs.
    <newline /><newline /><b>  Schriftart, Dropdown Menu:</b><newline /><newline />
    In diesem Kasten kann sowohl Schriftart, wie auch Schriftgröße aller Texte innerhalb des Arbeitsbereichs gewählt werden, die sich auf diese Option berufen.
    <newline /><newline /><b> Kurzbefehle: </b><newline /><newline /><table border="1"><tr><th>Tastenkürzel</th><th>Aktion</th></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + C:</b></td><td>Kopiert ausgewählte Komponenten in die Zwischenablage</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + V:</b></td><td>Fügt Komponenten aus der Zwischenablage in den Arbeitsbereich ein</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + X:</b></td><td>Schneidet ausgewählte Komponenten aus dem Arbeitsbereich aus</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Z:</b></td><td>Widerruft letzten Befehl</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Y:</b></td><td>Führt letzten widerrufenen Befehl erneut aus</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Maus-Rad:</b></td><td>Verändert den Maßstab (Zoomen)</td></tr><tr><td><b>F11:</b></td><td>Anzeigen/Ausblenden von Komponenten-Browser und Parameterleiste</td></tr><tr><td><b>F12:</b></td><td>Anzeigen/ausblenden des Haupt-Ribbon-Bars</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + A:</b></td><td>Alle Komponenten auswählen</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Rechts:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten nach rechts ausrichten</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Links:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten nach links ausrichten</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Oben:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten nach oben ausrichten</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Unten:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten nach unten ausrichten</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Umschalt + Rechts:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten nach rechts verschieben</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Umschalt + Links:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten nach links verschieben</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Umschalt + Oben:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten nach oben verschieben</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Umschalt + Unten:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten nach unten verschieben</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Umschalt + X:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten horizontal verteilen</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Umschalt + Y:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten vertikal verteilen</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Umschalt + W:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten auf die größte Breite vergrößern</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + W:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten auf die kleinste Breite verkleinern</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Umschalt + H:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten auf die größte Höhe vergrößern</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + H:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten auf die kleinste Höhe verkleinern</td></tr></table></usage>

    The CrypTool Workspace Manager (CWM) is – besides and even more than the Wizard and the Crypto Tutorials – the most important and central utility of CrypTool 2 (CT2). The CWM allows the user to create, edit and structure workspaces.
    <newline />
    Within the workspace the user can arrange different components in a kind of graphical, modular programming language editor. Therefore, the Workspace Manager provides a WIMP (windows, menus, icons, pointers) based user interface to organize and structure components on the workspace. Components are the foundations of CT2, because they are used within the other utilities (Wizard and CWM) and because they make it possible to combine and create different algorithms and to test and experiment with them, in order to improve the knowledge about cryptography of the user.
    <newline />
    To process and pass data from one component to another, the user can connect the components on the workspace, so that the user is capable to implement his own crypto algorithms and protocols.
    <newline />
    A new workspace can be created by pressing the workspace button in the dropdown menu of the "New" button in the File section of the "Home" ribbon tab, in the left upper edge of the CT2 menu, like shown in the picture.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/unbenannt.png" caption="Figure 1" /><newline /><newline />
    The state of a workspace can be saved in a file including all components, settings and connections. Therefore the state can  later be recalled again by pressing the "Open" button in the "File" section of the Home ribbon tab. Workspaces can also be printed or saved on disk as picture files, by pressing the "Print" button in the File section of the Home ribbon tab.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/unbenannt2.png" caption="Figure 2" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/unbenannt3.png" caption="Figure 3" /><newline /><newline />
    Components can be arranged on the whole workspace and they are represented in three ways: minimized, in windows mode and in fullscreen mode.
    <enum><item>
        Minimized, the component depicts as a minimal window, as shown in figure 2, that contains the icon of the component, the inputs and outputs as well as the "window control buttons" to maximize the component to a window, enter fullscreen mode and deletion of the component.
      </item><item>
        In window mode, the component shows a view of the component as shown in figure 3. Which view is to be shown can be chosen in a small toolbar in the upper left corner of the components window. When in window mode, the window size of the component can be changed by the user.
      </item><item>
        The fullscreen mode shows the actual view in the size of the entire space of the tab of the workspace as shown in figure 4.
      </item><item>
        Additional the CWM offers on the left a overview list of all components on the workspace to improve the velocity of switching between them.
      </item><item>
        If the workspace is in play mode, a progress bar at the bottom of each view illustrates the progress of the actual component. In case new messages occur, a notification in the progress bar displays them in the color of their type.
      </item></enum><newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/unbenannt4.png" caption="Figure 4" /><newline /><newline /><b>The four different views</b><newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/enigma1.png" caption="Figure 5" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/enigma2.png" caption="Figure 6" /><newline /><newline />
    Each component offers up to four different views: Presentation, Settings, Data, Log. <newline />
    These views can be distinguished according to their accountability between component developer set views, like the presentation and the settings (see figures 5 and 6), and the CWM set views, named Data and Log. The developer of the component is responsible for the content of the presentation and settings views. Note, that a presentation view need not be offered by all components and is individual for each component, while the other views are generated by default.
    <enum><item>
        The Data view represents the data that is present in the component, as in case of figure 7 a string.
      </item><item>
        The Log view stores and represents warning, error, info and debug notifications of the component (see figure 8). A click on the delete button removes all messages so far.
      </item><item>
        In window mode, the CWM offers a help button with which the user can directly access the documentation of the actual component.
      </item><item>
        The settings/parameters are the only views, that also can be shown in the parameters bar on the right of the workspace tab.
      </item></enum><newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/enigma4.png" caption="Figure 7" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/enigma3.png" caption="Figure 8" /><newline /><newline />
    All workspaces are arranged in the TAB BAR, right above the actual opened workspace.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Building a workspace</b><newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/suggestionlist.png" caption="Figure 9" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/textinout.png" caption="Figure 10" /><newline /><newline />
    In the menu on the left, the user can browse through the installed components of CT2 or alternatively use the search feature. The components are sorted in groups like Classical Ciphers, Steganography, Tools, etc., to enhance the browsing experience. Components may be added to the actual workspace by double-click or simple drag-and drop into the workspace. Components can be connected within the workspace through connections. These connections, represented in the workspace as black lines, could be created by holding the left mouse button on the input- or output of the starting component and releasing on the input- or output of the target component, which should be connected. In order to clear up the workspace, the parts of connections between two bends could be shifted lengthwise. Note that each component got input- and output connectors and that an output connector, symbolized by an away pointing arrow, can only be connected to an input connector, symbolized by an towards pointing arrow.  By pressing and holding the right mouse button, these arrows can be shifted around the component, in order to customize the workspace.
    The type of the inputs and outputs that should be connected have to be the same, or at least compatible. The CWM signals which inputs or outputs in the actual workspace are compatible by blinking and serves a pop-up when the cursor is over a possible target connector, whether the connector is of the same type, compatible or incompatible. In addition to this way to connect two components, the CWM offers a suggestion-list of components which may be connected. An example of a suggestion list can be seen in figure 9. By drawing a connection through holding the left mouse button from an input or output connector into empty space of the workspace and releasing the button, the list appears at the last position of the cursor and the user can choose a compatible component. The list is sorted by usage incidence of the components.

    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/playstop.png" caption="Figure 11" /><newline /><newline />

    The workspace can be controlled by the "Execute" ribbon in the main ribbon bar on top of the whole window. A workspace can be started by pressing the "Play" button, highlighted in figure 11, and stopped by pressing the "Stop" button. Starting a workspace causes the execution methods of the components in this workspace. A component executes only if data is present to all inputs, that are needed for the execution and is restarted when/if the data has changed. In order to guarantee a correct execution, please pay attention to the logs and read the documentation of the component. Every workspace has to be started separately. Note that several components need data input for their execution.

    <newline /><newline /><b>Organizing tools</b><newline /><newline />

    The CWM offers several tools to organize the workspace.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Zoom</b><newline /><newline />

    On the lower left corner of the workspace is the "Zoom Bar" (see figure 12). It is used to change the scale of the actual workplace. To automatically choose the scale to fit the whole workspace into the screen, the "fit-to-screen" button in the toolbar at the top center of the workspace is to be used. Alternatively the zoom can be changed by holding CTRL and scrolling with the mouse wheel. <newline /><newline />
    A left mouse button click on the percentage zoom level indicator readjusts the zoom level too 100%.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/zoom.png" caption="Figure 12" /><newline /><newline />
    Text Areas and Picture Box:<newline /><newline />
    Texts and pictures can be added to a workspace without the usage of additional components. The "text area box" button and the "picture box" button in figure 13 offer tools to create text areas and load pictures directly into the workspace. The boxes can be dragged and positioned like components. Editing tools for the text area appear on top of the workspace as a new toolbar, if the text area is focused. The size of the areas can be customized by the user through pressing and holding the downer right edge of the box. Note that the text area and picture boxes cannot interact with other components on the workspace and are always in the background of the workspace.
    <newline /><newline /><newline /><b>Component layout</b><newline /><newline />
    The components can be arbitrarily placed on the workspace by dragging them with the mouse, but it is difficult to obtain an exact placement of the components that way.
    Thus the CWM provides several functions that support exact component placement. These functions are accessible via the context menu that appears, when you right-click the mouse
    in the workspace:
    <newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/layouthelpers_en.png" caption="Figure 13" /><newline /><b>Alignment:</b>
    Select at least two components and call the context menu by right-clicking the mouse in the workspace. Choose one of the "Alignment" functions. If you choose for example "Align Right",
    all selected components will be moved so far to the right, that their right edges will coincide with the rightmost edge of all selected components.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Movement:</b>
    Select at least one component and call the context menu by right-clicking the mouse in the workspace. With the "Movement" functions, you can move all selected components at once by one pixel in the selected direction.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Spreading:</b>
    Select at least three components and call the context menu by right-clicking the mouse in the workspace. Choose one of the "Spreading" functions. If you choose for example "Spread Horizontal",
    the leftmost and the rightmost of the selected components will be fixed. The remaining selected components will then be moved horizontally in such a way, that the horizontal distances between them are all the same,
    while preserving their horizontal order.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Size adjustment:</b>
    Select at least two components and call the context menu by right-clicking the mouse in the workspace. With the "Size adjustment" functions, you can set the widths or the heights of all selected components to the same value at once.
    You can choose, whether the widths or the heights should be set to the smallest or the biggest value of all selected components.
    <newline /><newline />
    Please note that in the context menu only those functions are activated, for which the number of selected components allows a meaningful application of the function.
    Example: Aligning components is not possible, if only one component is selected. In that case, the alignment functions are deactivated.
    <newline /><newline />
    All layout functions can also be called with a keyboard shortcut. The shortcuts are displayed in the context menu.
    <newline /><newline /><newline /><b>Parameters</b><newline /><newline />
    For adjusting the settings of a component, the CWM offers the so called "Parameters Bar", like the one shown in figure 14, on the right side of the actual workspace tab. It can be fade in and out by pressing the button on top of the Bar, as well as re-sized in width. It displays the settings of the actually focused component, similar to the view: setting of the component window.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/parameters.png" caption="Figure 14" /><newline /><newline /><b>Embedded components</b><newline /><newline />
    With the target of development of more universal components, CT2 offers an interface, that is called "embedded component" in the CrypTool language.

    This interface makes it possible to extend components according to the modular design principle.

    The difference between a connection in the workspace over the connectors and an extension through the embedded component interface is, that in the embedded components interface one component may control the other. In CrypTool terminology, we talk about master- and slave components. The master (or main) component integrates the slave components, controls them and is allowed to access their functions. This is because master components can be dependent on functions of the slave component or an equivalent implementation on the workspace would be complicated.
    From the technical view, this approach reduces redundancy in the programming. Further components (i.e. KeySearcher) can be reused in various application possibilities (i.e. different encryption methods).
    <newline /><newline />
    Embedded components can be set by clicking the left mouse button on the bolt icon next to the window controls, as seen in figure 15. The components in the embedded component interface can be set and switched by clicking on the button underneath the component icons. They can be chosen from a vertical menu which lists up all components that support the defined interface, as can be seen in figure 16.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/thunderbolt.png" caption="Figure 15" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/thunderbolt2.png" caption="Figure 16" /><newline /><newline />
    The settings of components that are integrated through the embedded component interface can be set in separate tabs in the view: "settings" of the component that contains them.
    <newline /><newline />
    When creating a workspace and using a component which supports embedded components, the user should read the documentation of the component, in order to set the right embedded component components and settings. Note that several components need components in the embedded component interface.

    <newline /><newline /><newline /><newline /><b>Global settings</b><newline /><newline />
    In the "Main Settings Menu" of CT2 in the "Workspace" section can be set global settings for all workspaces.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Global progress bar, Checkbox:</b><newline />
    The selection of this checkbox affects the appearance of a progress bar after the start of a workspace, which represents the progression of all components within the workspace as a bar in the upper area of the workspace tabulator.
    <newline /><b>Show component connection proposition, Checkbox:</b><newline />
    By setting this checkbox, you can decided whether the list of connection suggestions should be displayed or not.
    <newline /><b>Component connection suggestion delay, Slider:</b><newline />
    With this slider, the time between holding the left mouse button and the event of showing the list of connection proposals can be varied.
    <newline /><b>Reset component connection statistics, Button:</b><newline />
    Pressing this button causes a reset of the statistics that is needed to create the connection suggestions. The statistics will then be recreated automatically according to the new usage of the components.
    <newline /><b>Standard appearance of components, Combo Box:</b><newline />
    Within this combo box can be selected whether components are always open by default (i.e. showing one of the four views), closed (i.e. in the smallest possible representation only the icon is to be displayed), or whether the components should make that decision by themselves.
    <newline /><b>GUI update interval, Slider:</b><newline />
    This slider determines how often the surface of the workspace and thus the representations of the components are to be updated. The time interval is specified in milliseconds.
    <newline /><b>Synchronous events, Checkbox:</b><newline />
    Sets the behavior of event handling of the execution engine.
    <newline /><b>Benchmark, Checkbox:</b><newline />
    If this checkbox is active, the execution engine benchmarks the executed functions.
    <newline /><b>Data type colors, Dropdown Menu:</b><newline />
    With these drop down menus the colors representing the different data types within the workspace can be changed.
    <newline /><b>Function colors, Dropdown Menu:</b><newline />
    With these drop down menus the colors representing the different functions within the workspace can be changed.
    <newline /><b>Reset colors, Button:</b><newline />
    Pressing this button resets the colors for the representation of data types and functions within the workspace to the default values.
    <newline /><b>Fonts, Dropdown Menu:</b><newline />
    In this menu can be selected the font type and size of all texts within the workspace, which invoke this option.

  <usage lang="de">
    Der CrypTool Workspace Manager (CWM) ist – noch vor dem Wizard und den Crypto Tutorials – das wichtigste Werkzeug von CrypTool 2 (CT2). Der Workspace Manager erlaubt es dem Benutzer, die Arbeitsbereiche (engl.: workspaces) zu erstellen, zu editieren und zu strukturieren.
    <newline />
    Im Arbeitsbereich [einer WIMP (windows, menus, icons, pointers) - gestützten Benutzeroberfläche] kann man als Benutzer die verschiedenen Komponenten in einer grafischen, modularen Programmiersprache arrangieren. Intern wird dies vom Arbeitsplatz-Manager (Workspace Manager) durchgeführt, um die Komponenten zu organisieren und zu strukturieren. Komponenten sind das Basiselement von CT2, da sie in allen Utilities (Wizard, CWM) benutzt werden und es ermöglichen, auf einfache Weise verschiedene Krypto-Algorithmen und Protokolle zu erzeugen, sie zu testen und mit ihnen zu experimentieren. Damit kann man sein Wissen über Kryptografie schnell erweitern.
    <newline />
    Um Daten zu verarbeiten und zwischen den Komponenten auszutauschen, kann der Benutzer die Komponenten miteinander verbinden. Dadurch wird der Benutzer in die Lage versetzt, eigene Algorithmen zu entwickeln und Chiffren zu ver- und/oder entschlüsseln.
    <newline />
    Neue Arbeitsbereiche können erzeugt werden, indem man auf die „Arbeitsbereich“- Schaltfläche in dem Dropdown-Menü der „Neu“- Schaltfläche in der „Datei“- Rubrik des "Start"-Ribbons, in der linken oberen Ecke des CT2-Fensters, wie man dies in Abbildung 1 sieht.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/unbenannt.png" caption="Abbildung 1" /><newline /><newline />
    Der Status des Arbeitsbereichs kann zusammen mit allen Komponenten, ihren Verbindungen und Einstellungen in einer Datei auf der Festplatte gespeichert werden. Gespeicherte Dateien können später mit einem Klick auf die „Öffnen“- Schaltfläche wieder als Arbeitsbereich geladen werden. Die grafische Repräsentation der Arbeitsbereiches, kann mit Hilfe der „Drucken“- Schaltfläche des Start-Ribbons in eine Bilddatei auf die Festplatte geschrieben werden.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/unbenannt2.png" caption="Abbildung 2" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/unbenannt3.png" caption="Abbildung 3" /><newline /><newline />
    Komponenten können im gesamten Arbeitsbereich platziert werden und werden dabei in drei verschiedenen Weisen dargestellt: minimiert, als Fenster und im Vollbild-Modus.
    <enum><item>
        Minimiert erscheint die Komponente lediglich als eine Art kleines Fenster, wie in Abbildung 2 zu sehen, das die Ikone der Komponente enthält, die Ein – und Ausgänge, sowie Steuerungsschaltflächen zum Erweitern des Fensters, zum Eintritt in den Vollbild-Modus und zum Entfernen der Komponente aus dem aktuellen Arbeitsbereich.
      </item><item>
        Zu einem Fenster vergrößert beinhaltet die Komponente eine von vier verschiedenen „Ansichten“ (engl.: views), wie in Abbildung 3 dargestellt. Welche Ansicht dargestellt werden soll kann in einer Werkzeugleiste in der linken oberen Ecke des Fensters ausgewählt werden. Im Fensterzustand kann die Fenstergröße vom Benutzer festgelegt werden. Ist der Arbeitsbereich im Ausführungsmodus, zeigt ein Fortschrittsbalken unterhalb jeder Komponente deren Fortschritt. Sollten neue Nachrichten verfügbar sein, erscheint in der Fortschrittsanzeige eine Benachrichtigung in der Farbe ihres Typs.
      </item><item>
        Im Vollbild-Modus wird die aktuelle Ansicht über den gesamten Bereich des Arbeitsbereiches dargestellt, wie in Abbildung 4 zu sehen ist. Auf der linken Seite bietet der CWM eine Liste aller Komponenten im Arbeitsbereich, um den Wechsel zwischen den Komponenten zu beschleunigen.
      </item></enum><newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/unbenannt4.png" caption="Abbildung 4" /><newline /><newline /><b>Vier verschiedene Ansichten</b><newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/enigma1.png" caption="Abbildung 5" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/enigma2.png" caption="Abbildung 6" /><newline /><newline />
    Jede Komponente bietet bis zu vier verschiedene „Ansichten“ an: Präsentation, Einstellungen, Daten, Log. <newline /><newline />
    Diese Ansichten können grob anhand ihres Inhaltes unterschieden werden. Der Entwickler kann den Inhalt von Präsentation und Einstellungen festlegen, welche in den Abbildungen 5 und 6 zu sehen sind, während der Inhalt von Daten und Log der CWM festgelegt. Für den Inhalt der Ansicht Präsentation und Einstellungen ist demnach der Entwickler der Komponente verantwortlich. Beachten Sie, dass die Präsentations-Ansicht nicht von jeder Komponente angeboten werden muss und die Darstellung individuell ist, während die Darstellung der anderen Ansichten statisch vom CWM erzeugt wird. In der Ansicht "Einstellungen" können alle Parameter der Komponente festgelegt werden. Die Daten-Ansicht stellt dar, welche Daten an der Komponente anliegen, wie im Falle von Abbildung 7 ein String. Die Log-Ansicht zeigt Warnungen, Fehler, Informationen oder Debug-Benachrichtigungen der Komponente, wie in Abbildung 8 zu sehen ist. Ein Klick auf die „Entfernen“- Schaltfläche entfernt alle bisherigen Nachrichten. <newline />
    Im Fenstermodus bietet der CWM eine „Hilfe“-Schaltfläche an, mit welcher der Benutzer direkt die Dokumentation der aktuellen Komponente aufrufen kann. Die Einstellungen sind die einzige Ansicht, welche auch in der Parameterleiste am rechten Bildrand des Arbeitsbereichs-Tabs angezeigt werden kann.

    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/enigma4.png" caption="Abbildung 7" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/enigma3.png" caption="Abbildung 8" /><newline /><newline />
    Alle Arbeitsbereiche werden in einer Tabulator-Leiste über dem aktuell geöffneten Arbeitsbereich organisiert.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Erstellen eines Arbeitsbereichs</b><newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/textinout.png" caption="Abbildung 9" /><newline /><newline />
    Im Menü am linken Bildrand kann der Benutzer durch die installierten Komponenten von CT2 stöbern, oder alternativ das Such-Werkzeug benutzen. Um dem Benutzer die Suche nach der richtigen Komponente zu vereinfachen, sind die Komponenten geordnet nach Gruppen wie klassische Chiffren, Steganografie, Werkzeuge, usw. Komponenten können dann per Doppelklick oder einfachem Drag-und-Drop dem aktuellen Arbeitsbereich hinzugefügt werden. Innerhalb des Arbeitsbereiches können Komponenten verbunden werden. Diese Verbindungen, im Arbeitsbereich dargestellt durch schwarze Linien, können durch Halten der linken Maustaste auf dem Ein- oder Ausgang der Ausgangs-Komponente und Loslassen auf dem Aus- oder Eingang der Ziel-Komponente durch den Benutzer erstellt werden. Um den Arbeitsbereich übersichtlich zu halten, können die Teile der Verbindungen, welche sich zwischen zwei Abzweigungen befinden, durch Halten der linken Maustaste und Ziehen längsseits verschoben werden. Jede Komponente besitzt Ein- und/oder Ausgänge. Eingänge können nur mit Ausgängen, sowie Ausgänge nur mit Eingängen verbunden werden. Eingänge werden durch zur Komponente hinzeigende Pfeile und Ausgänge durch weg zeigende Pfeilsymbole dargestellt. Diese Pfeilsymbole können durch Drücken und Halten der rechten Maustaste vom Benutzer vollständig rings um die Darstellung der Komponente herum positioniert werden, um den Arbeitsbereich weiter anzupassen.
    <newline />
    Bitte beachten Sie, dass der Typ der zu verbindenden Ein- und Ausgänge stets derselbe oder wenigstens kompatibel sein muss. Der CWM signalisiert durch Blinken, welche Ein- und Ausgaben des aktuellen Arbeitsbereiches kompatibel sind und zeigt in einem Einblend-Menü, wenn sich der Mauszeiger über dem zu verbindenden Konnektor befindet, ob der Konnektor vom selben Typ, kompatibel oder inkompatibel ist. Zusätzlich zu dieser Art, Komponenten zu verbinden, bietet der CWM eine Vorschlagsliste an, welche Komponenten verbunden werden können. Ein Beispiel für solch eine Vorschlagsliste ist in Abbildung 10 zu sehen. Durch Zeichnen einer Verbindung, angefangen von einem Ein- oder Ausgabe-Konnektor hinein in den freien Raum des Arbeitsbereiches, und Loslassen der Maustaste, erscheint die Liste an der letzten Position des Mauszeigers und der Benutzer kann eine kompatible Komponente aus dieser Liste wählen. Die Sortierung der Liste richtet sich absteigend nach der Häufigkeit der Benutzung der Komponenten durch den Benutzer.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/suggestionlist.png" caption="Abbildung 10" /><newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/playstop.png" caption="Abbildung 11" /><newline /><newline />

    Der Arbeitsbereich kann mit Hilfe des „Ausführen“-Ribbons in der Haupt-Ribbon-Bar im oberen Abschnitt des gesamten Fensters kontrolliert werden. Arbeitsbereiche können durch Drücken der „Starten“-Schaltfläche, zu sehen in Abbildung 11, gestartet und durch Drücken der „Stoppen“-Schaltfläche angehalten werden. Eine Komponente wird nur dann ausgeführt, wenn an allen Eingängen Daten anliegen, die für die Ausführung notwendig sind. Hier sei auf die Dokumentation der jeweiligen Komponente verwiesen, um eine korrekte Ausführung sicher zu stellen, und darauf, dass auf eventuelle Benachrichtigungen in der Log-Rubrik der Komponente zu achten ist. Jeder Arbeitsbereich muss einzeln gestartet werden. Es sei noch einmal erwähnt, dass viele Komponenten Eingaben für ihre Ausführung zwingend benötigen.


    <newline /><newline /><b>Organisationswerkzeuge </b><newline /><newline />

    Der CWM bietet verschiedene Werkzeuge zur Organisation der Arbeitsbereiche an.

    <newline /><newline /><b>Zoom </b><newline /><newline />

    In der unteren linken Ecke befindet sich die „Zoom-Leiste“, die in etwa so aussehen sollte wie in Abbildung 12 zu sehen. Sie dient dazu, den Maßstab des aktuellen Arbeitsbereiches zu variieren. Um den Maßstab automatisch so anzupassen, dass der gesamte Arbeitsbereich zu sehen ist, sollte die Schaltfläche „Fit-to-screen“ (das Symbol dazu ist in der Mitte oberhalb des Arbeitsbereiches) verwendet werden. Alternativ kann zum Zoomen auch das Maus-Rad benutzt werden, wenn beim Rollen die Strg-Taste gehalten wird. Ein Klick mit der linken Maustaste auf die Prozent-Angabe der Zoom-Leiste, setzt diese auf 100%.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/zoom.png" caption="Abbildung 12" /><newline /><newline /><b>Layout der Komponenten</b><newline /><newline />
    Die Komponenten können mit der Maus beliebig auf dem Arbeitsbereich verschoben werden. Allerdings ist es schwierig, auf diese Art die Komponenten exakt zu platzieren.
    Daher stellt der CWM einige Funktionen zur Verfügung, die ein exaktes Layout der Komponenten ermöglichen. Diese Funktionen sind über das Kontextmenü aufrufbar, das erscheint, wenn Sie
    im Arbeitsbereich die rechte Maustaste drücken:
    <newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/layouthelpers_de.png" caption="Abbildung 13" /><newline /><b>Ausrichten:</b>
    Wählen Sie mindestens zwei Komponenten aus und rufen dann das Kontextmenü durch Rechtsklick im Arbeitsbereich auf. Wählen Sie eine der Ausrichten-Funktionen. Wenn Sie z.B. "Rechts ausrichten" wählen,
    werden alle ausgewählten Komponenten horizontal so weit nach rechts verschoben, dass ihre rechte Kante mit der am weitesten rechts liegenden rechten Kante aller ausgewählten Komponenten übereinstimmt.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Verschieben:</b>
    Wählen Sie mindestens eine Komponente aus und rufen dann das Kontextmenü durch Rechtsklick im Arbeitsbereich auf. Mit den Verschiebe-Funktionen können Sie alle ausgewählten Komponenten gleichzeitig um eine Pixelbreite in die
    ausgewählte Richtung verschieben.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Verteilen:</b>
    Wählen Sie mindestens drei Komponenten aus und rufen dann das Kontextmenü durch Rechtsklick im Arbeitsbereich auf. Wählen Sie eine der Verteil-Funktionen. Wenn Sie z.B. "Horizontal verteilen" wählen,
    werden die am weitesten links und rechts liegenden der ausgewählten Komponenten bestimmt und fixiert. Die restlichen ausgewählten Komponenten werden dann (unter Beibehaltung der Reihenfolge) horizontal so verschoben,
    dass ihre horizontalen Abstände voneinander alle gleich sind.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Größenanpassung:</b>
    Wählen Sie mindestens zwei Komponenten aus und rufen dann das Kontextmenü durch Rechtsklick im Arbeitsbereich auf. Mit den Größenanpassungs-Funktionen können Sie die Breiten oder Höhen aller ausgewählten Komponenten gleichzeitig auf den
    selben Wert setzen. Sie können dabei wählen, ob die Breiten oder Höhen der Komponenten auf den größten oder kleinsten Wert unter den ausgewählten Komponenten gesetzt werden soll.
    <newline /><newline />
    Bitte beachten Sie, dass eine Funktion im Kontext-Menü nur dann aktiviert ist, wenn sie für die Anzahl der ausgewählten Komponenten sinnvoll ist. Es ist beispielsweise kein Ausrichten von Komponenten möglich, wenn nur eine Komponente
    ausgewählt wurde. In diesem Fall sind die Ausrichten-Funktionen deaktiviert.
    <newline /><newline />
    Alle Layout-Funktionen sind auch über Tastaturkürzel aufrufbar. Die zu den einzelnen Funktionen gehörigen Tastaturkürzel werden im Kontextmenü angezeigt.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Textfeld und Bilderfeld</b><newline /><newline />
    Texte und Bilder können – ohne von einer weiteren Komponente Gebrauch zu machen – direkt dem Arbeitsbereich hinzugefügt werden. Die Textfeld-Schaltfläche und die Bildfeld-Schaltfläche bieten, wie in Abbildung 13 zu sehen, Werkzeuge, um Texte zu erzeugen und Bilder direkt in den Hintergrund des Arbeitsbereiches zu laden. Beide Bereiche können im Arbeitsbereich verschoben werden wie Komponenten. Wenn das Textfeld fokussiert ist, erscheint oberhalb des Arbeitsbereiches eine Werkzeugleiste zur Formatierung des Textes. Die Größe des Bereichs kann durch Halten und Ziehen der unteren rechten Ecke des Textfeldes verändert werden. Diese beiden Werkzeuge können nicht mit den normalen Komponenten interagieren und bleiben stets im Hintergrund des Arbeitsbereiches. Man kann Textfelder benutzen für Memos oder für kurze Beschreibungen, was man mit dem aktuellen Workspace machen kann. Mit den Bildfelder kann man rein optisch auch Komponenten gruppieren.
    <newline /><newline /><b>Parameter-Leiste</b><newline /><newline />
    Zum Justieren der Einstellungen von Komponenten bietet der CWM auf der rechten Seite des aktuellen Arbeitsbereiches die so genannte "Parameter-Leiste" an (siehe Abbildung 14). Diese kann sowohl ein- als auch ausgeblendet werden (mit Hilfe der Schaltfläche oberhalb der Leiste), so wie in der Breite verändert werden. Ihr Inhalt entspricht der Einstellungsansicht der Komponente, die gerade den Fokus hat.

    Mit dem Ziel, Komponenten möglichst universell gestalten zu können, bietet CT2 eine Schnittstelle an, welche in der CrypTool Sprache "integrierte Komponenten" genannt wird.

    Diese Schnittstelle macht es möglich, Komponenten modular nach dem Baukastenprinzip durch andere Komponenten zu erweitern.

    Der Unterschied zwischen einer Verbindung im Arbeitsbereich, über die Konnektoren und einer Erweiterung durch die Schnittstelle für integrierte Komponenten, besteht darin, dass eine Komponente die andere steuern kann. Hierbei wird von Master- und Slave-Komponenten (engl. für Meister und Knecht) gesprochen. Die Master-Komponente ist dabei die Hauptkomponente, die die Slave-Komponente einbindet, steuert und auf deren Funktionen zugreifen kann. Der Hintergrund ist der, dass die Master-Komponente beispielsweise auf Funktionen der Slave-Komponente angewiesen ist, oder aber auch dass eine äquivalente Implementierung über den Arbeitsbereich kompliziert wäre.
    Technisch gesehen reduziert dies Redundanzen bei der Programmierung und macht Komponenten (wie z.B. den KeySearcher) für verschiedene Einsatzmöglichkeiten (z.B. verschiedene Verschlüsselungsverfahren) wiederverwendbar.
    <newline /><newline />
    Unterstützt eine Komponente die Funktionalität für integrierte Komponenten, befindet sich neben den normalen Fenster-Kontrollelementen ein Blitzsymbol, wie in Abbildung 15 zu sehen. Die Komponenten können durch Anklicken der Schaltfläche unterhalb der Ikonen eingesetzt und getauscht werden. Ein vertikales Auswahl-Menü listet alle Komponenten auf, welche die definierte integrierte Komponenten-Schnittstelle unterstützen: siehe Abbildung 16.
    <newline /><newline /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/thunderbolt.png" caption="Abbildung 15" /><img src="WorkspaceManager/DetailedDescription/Images/thunderbolt2.png" caption="Abbildung 16" /><newline /><newline />
    Die Einstellungen der eingebundenen Komponenten erscheinen in eigenen Reitern, in der Ansicht "Einstellungen" der Komponente, die sie einbindet.
    <newline /><newline />
    Beim Erstellen eines Arbeitsbereiches mit Komponenten, die integrierte Komponenten unterstützen, sollten Sie als Benutzer sorgfältig die Dokumentation der Komponente lesen, um die richtigen Komponenten und Einstellungen zu wählen. Manche Komponenten benötigen zur Ausführung zwingend Komponenten für die integrierte Komponenten-Schnittstelle.

    <newline /><newline /><newline /><newline /><b>Globale Einstellungen</b><newline /><newline />
    In den "Haupteinstellungen" von CT2 im Abschnitt "Arbeitsbereich" können globale Einstellungen für alle Arbeitsbereiche festgelegt werden.
    <newline /><newline /><b>  Globaler Fortschrittsbalken, Kontrollkästchen:</b><newline /><newline />
    Das Setzen dieses Kontrollkästchens bewirkt, dass nach dem Start eines Arbeitsbereiches eine Fortschrittsanzeige oberhalb des Tabulatorfensters erscheint, welche den Verlauf des Arbeitsbereichs als Balken darstellt.
    <newline /><newline /><b>  Zeige Komponenten-Verbindungsvorschläge, Kontrollkästchen:</b><newline /><newline />
    Mit dem Setzen dieses Kontrollkästchens kann entschieden werden, ob die Liste mit Verbindungsvorschlägen angezeigt werden soll oder nicht.
    <newline /><newline /><b> Verzögerung des Komponenten-Verbindungsvorschlags, Schieber:</b><newline /><newline />
    Mit Hilfe dieses Schiebereglers kann die Zeit zwischen Halten und Anzeigen der Liste mit Verbindungsvorschlägen variiert werden.
    <newline /><newline /><b>  Komponenten-Konnektoren-Statistik zurücksetzen, Schaltfläche:</b><newline /><newline />
    Das Drücken dieser Schaltfläche bewirkt ein Zurücksetzen der Statistik, die zur Erstellung der Verbindungsvorschläge nötig ist. Die Statistik wird danach automatisch gemäß der Benutzung neu erstellt.
    <newline /><newline /><b>  Standardmäßige Darstellung von Komponenten, Auswahlfeld:</b><newline /><newline />
    In diesem Auswahlfeld kann gewählt werden, ob Komponenten standardmäßig geöffnet (also unter Darstellung einer der vier Ansichten) oder geschlossen (also in der kleinstmöglichen Repräsentation, bei der nur das Icon der Komponente angezeigt wird) dargestellt werden sollen, oder ob die Komponente diese Entscheidung selbst treffen soll.
    <newline /><newline /><b>  GUI Update-Intervall, Schieberegler:</b><newline /><newline />
    Mit diesem Schieberegler kann bestimmt werden, wie oft die Oberfläche des Arbeitsbereichs und damit auch die Darstellungen der Komponenten aktualisiert werden sollen. Die Intervalldauer wird in Millisekunden angegeben.
    <newline /><newline /><b>  Synchrone Ereignisse, Kontrollkästchen:</b><newline /><newline />
    Wählt die Art der Ereignisbehandlung der Ausführungsmaschine
    <newline /><newline /><b>   Benchmark, Kontrollkästchen:</b><newline /><newline />
    In diesem Kontrollkästchen kann eingestellt werden, ob die Ausführungsmaschine die aufgerufenen Funktionen auf Sekundenbasis evaluieren soll oder nicht.
    <newline /><newline /><b>  Datentyp-Farben, Dropdown Menu:</b><newline /><newline />
    In diesen Dropdown-Menüs kann eingestellt werden, in welchen Farben die verschiedenen Datentypen innerhalb des Arbeitsbereiches dargestellt werden.
    <newline /><newline /><b>   Funktionen-Farben, Dropdown Menu:</b><newline /><newline />
    In diesen Dropdown-Menüs kann eingestellt werden, in welchen Farben die verschiedenen Funktionen innerhalb des Arbeitsbereiches dargestellt werden.
    <newline /><newline /><b>   Farben zurücksetzen, Schaltfläche:</b><newline /><newline />
    Das Drücken dieser Schaltfläche bewirkt ein Zurücksetzen der Farben für die Darstellung von Datentypen und Funktionen innerhalb des Arbeitsbereichs.
    <newline /><newline /><b>  Schriftart, Dropdown Menu:</b><newline /><newline />
    In diesem Kasten kann sowohl Schriftart, wie auch Schriftgröße aller Texte innerhalb des Arbeitsbereichs gewählt werden, die sich auf diese Option berufen.
    <newline /><newline /><b> Kurzbefehle: </b><newline /><newline /><table border="1"><tr><th>Tastenkürzel</th><th>Aktion</th></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + C:</b></td><td>Kopiert ausgewählte Komponenten in die Zwischenablage</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + V:</b></td><td>Fügt Komponenten aus der Zwischenablage in den Arbeitsbereich ein</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + X:</b></td><td>Schneidet ausgewählte Komponenten aus dem Arbeitsbereich aus</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Z:</b></td><td>Widerruft letzten Befehl</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Y:</b></td><td>Führt letzten widerrufenen Befehl erneut aus</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Maus-Rad:</b></td><td>Verändert den Maßstab (Zoomen)</td></tr><tr><td><b>F11:</b></td><td>Anzeigen/Ausblenden von Komponenten-Browser und Parameterleiste</td></tr><tr><td><b>F12:</b></td><td>Anzeigen/ausblenden des Haupt-Ribbon-Bars</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + A:</b></td><td>Alle Komponenten auswählen</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Rechts:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten nach rechts ausrichten</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Links:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten nach links ausrichten</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Oben:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten nach oben ausrichten</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Unten:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten nach unten ausrichten</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Umschalt + Rechts:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten nach rechts verschieben</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Umschalt + Links:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten nach links verschieben</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Umschalt + Oben:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten nach oben verschieben</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Umschalt + Unten:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten nach unten verschieben</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Umschalt + X:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten horizontal verteilen</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Umschalt + Y:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten vertikal verteilen</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Umschalt + W:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten auf die größte Breite vergrößern</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + W:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten auf die kleinste Breite verkleinern</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + Umschalt + H:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten auf die größte Höhe vergrößern</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strg + H:</b></td><td>Ausgewählte Komponenten auf die kleinste Höhe verkleinern</td></tr></table></usage>

<h2>RSA key generation</h2>

An RSA key pair is required in order to generate a PKCS#1 signature. It consists of a private and a public key. The modulus is part of both the public and the private key.</br>
For the presented attack on the PKCS#1 signatures the value of the public key and the bit size of the modulus are required. These parameters can be entered in this tab. The private key and the modulus are then generated from these parameters.

<strong>Please notice that you have to generate a key before you can generate the signatures!</strong>

<h2>Generate the Kuehn signature</h2>

In this tab you can generate a faked signature using the method described by Ulrich Kuehn.
The structure of the signatures is similar to that of the <a href="help://Gen_Bleichenb_Sig_Tab">Bleichenbacher attack</a>. 
It is also applicable to signatures with a length of 1024 bits. The signatures have the following structure: '00' '01' PS '00' HI HD GG. </br>

The differences to the Bleichenbacher signatures are the following:
<ul>
  <li>
  The padding string has a fixed length of 8 bytes (64 bits). This length was chosen because some faulty implementations
  require different lengths of the padding string, but not more than 8 bytes. Thus the position of the hash identifier (HI) and the hash digest (HD) are also fixed.
  </li>
  <li>
  The appended garbage does not need to be calculated, but consists simply of appended bytes with the value 'FF'.</li>
</ul>

The Kuehn approach works like this: The cube root of the structure described above is extracted. Then the integer part
of the root is again raised to the third power. If the 46 leftmost bytes of the result have not changed in this process, we have
found a value that can be used to forge a signature.
These 46 bytes include:

<ul>
	<li><strong>'00' '01'</strong> leading bytes (2 bytes)</li>
	<li><strong>PS</strong> padding string (8 bytes)</li>
	<li><strong>'00'</strong> trailing zero byte (1 byte)</li>
	<li><strong>HI</strong> hash identifier (15 bytes (SHA-1))</li>
	<li><strong>HD</strong> hash digest (20 bytes (SHA-1))</li>
</ul>

If the 46 leftmost bytes do not match, the message that is to be signed is modified, resulting in a new hash value.
Again, by extracting the cube root and raising to the third power, it is checked whether the new hash value results
in a correct signature.
This process is repeated until the 46 leftmost bytes remain unchanged, which leads to a signature that is accepted as
valid by faulty implementations.</br>
In each iteration of this algorithm a cube root and a hash value have to be calculated. As these are expensive operations, 
the running time of this algorithm might be very long.
To limit the running time, a <a href="help://Gen_Kuehn_Iterations">maximum number of iterations</a> can be specified.</br></br>

The signature that is displayed in this tab is the result after cube root extraction and raising to the third power of the
signature that ends with 'FF' bytes. Thus the displayed signature does (most probably) not end with a block of 'FF' bytes.

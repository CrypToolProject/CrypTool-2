<h2>PKCS#1 signature generation</h2>

PKCS#1 signatures are based on the asymmetric encryption algorithm RSA. Therefore we need to generate an RSA key.</br>
In order to generate a PKCS#1 signature we first create a <a href="help://Gen_Datablock_Tab">data block</a> and a padding string, which helps to <a href="help://Gen_PKCS1_Sig_Tab">format</a> the signature in a specific way. The resulting data block is then signed with the private RSA key.
</br></br>
<strong>Please notice that you first have to generate an RSA key pair and a data block before you can generate the PKCS#1 signature!</strong>

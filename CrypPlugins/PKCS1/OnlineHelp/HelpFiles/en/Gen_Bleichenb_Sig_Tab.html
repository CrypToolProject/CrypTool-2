<h2>Generate Bleichenbacher signature</h2>

In this tab you can generate a faked signature. It is displayed in encrypted and in decrypted form.
A signature that is accepted by faulty implementations has the following structure:
'00' '01' PS '00' HI HD GG. </br>

In detail, this means:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>'00'</strong> 
Leading zero block (8 bit). This guarantees that the numerical value of the signature is less than the
<a href="help://KeyGen_ModulusSize">RSA modulus.</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>'01'</strong>
This block indicates whether we have an operation with a public or a private key.
As we use the private key for signature generation, it is set to '01'
</li>
<li>
<strong>PS</strong>
Padding string. The padding string consists of a number of blocks with the value 'FF'.
In a signature that is faked with the Bleichenbacher method, the padding string is shorter than the padding string of a correctly generated PKCS#1 signature.
You can choose the position of the data block (and thus the length of the padding string) in the control "Bit position of the data block".
</li>
<li>
<strong>'00'</strong>
Zero block. This block marks the end of the padding string and the start of the data block.
</li>
<li>
<strong>HI</strong>
Hash identifier. This is the first part of the <a href="help://Gen_Datablock_Tab">data block</a>.
It includes informations such as the used hash function in ASN.1 encoded form.
</li>
<li>
<strong>HD</strong>
Hash digest. The second part of the <a href="help://Gen_Datablock_Tab">data block</a> includes the generated hash value.
</li>
<li>
<strong>GG</strong>
Garbage. The last part of the faked signature consists of 'garbage data'.
It is required to match the length of the faked signature to the length of a correct signature.
The 'garbage data' is chosen such that it is a perfect cube.
</li>

</ul>

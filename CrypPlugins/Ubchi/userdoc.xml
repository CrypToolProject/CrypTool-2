		The ÜBCHI cipher was a double columnar transposition cipher used by the German Army at the beginning of World War I, starting in 1914. It represents one of the most important field ciphers of the early 20th century and played a significant role in military cryptography during WWI.

		The cipher consists of two sequential columnar transposition operations using mostly the same permutation key, with the addition of random null characters (dummy letters) between the two transpositions. The number of null characters typically equals the number of words in the keyword. This design was intended to provide strong security for tactical military communications while remaining practical for field use.

		Despite its theoretical strength, the ÜBCHI cipher was broken by French cryptanalysts, including Lieutenant Georges Painvin, in late 1914. The French success became widely publicized in the newspaper "Le Matin" in November 1914, forcing the Germans to abandon the cipher on November 18, 1914, and replace it with other systems.

	<usage lang="en">
		<b>Encryption Process:</b>

		1. <b>First Transposition:</b> The plaintext is written into a grid with a number of columns equal to the length of the keyword. The text is written row by row (left to right, top to bottom). The columns are then read out according to the alphabetical order of the keyword letters, creating the first intermediate ciphertext.

		2. <b>Adding Nulls:</b> A number of null characters (dummy letters) are appended to the intermediate ciphertext. The number of nulls traditionally equals the number of words in the keyword. These nulls can be random letters or frequency-based characters selected to match the statistical distribution of the language.

		3. <b>Second Transposition:</b> The intermediate ciphertext (with nulls) undergoes a second columnar transposition mostly using the same keyword and process as step 1, producing the final ciphertext.

		<b>Decryption Process:</b>

		Decryption reverses the encryption steps:

		1. <b>Reverse Second Transposition:</b> The ciphertext is arranged into columns according to the keyword permutation, then read row by row to recover the intermediate text with nulls.

		2. <b>Remove Nulls:</b> The known number of null characters is removed from the end of the intermediate text.

		3. <b>Reverse First Transposition:</b> A second reverse transposition recovers the original plaintext.

		<b>Key Management:</b>

		The plugin supports both single-key and dual-key modes. In dual-key mode, different keywords are used for the first and second transpositions, significantly increasing security. The plugin also includes options for custom key length validation and frequency-based null generation based on English letter statistics.

	<presentation lang="en">
		The visualization shows the complete encryption/decryption process with detailed step-by-step information:

		- <b>Input Information:</b> Displays the input text, key(s), action (encrypt/decrypt), and the number of null characters to be added/removed.

		- <b>Permutation:</b> Shows the numeric permutation derived from the keyword(s), which determines the column ordering.

		- <b>Step 1 - First Transposition:</b> Displays the grid with the permutation header showing column numbers, followed by the grid content and the intermediate result.

		- <b>Step 2 - Nulls:</b> Shows the addition (encryption) or removal (decryption) of null characters, with the number of nulls based on the keyword word count.

		- <b>Step 3 - Second Transposition:</b> Displays the second transposition grid and the final result.

		- <b>Final Result:</b> Shows the complete encrypted or decrypted text, formatted in groups of five characters for readability.

		The presentation uses thread-safe UI updates to ensure proper visualization even when the cipher runs in background threads.

# This package contains many very lovely tests.  Very few of them,\n\
# however, test for lagged correlations -- the possibility that\n\
# the random number generator has a bitlevel correlation after\n\
# some fixed number of intervening bits.\n\
#\n\
# The lagged sums test is therefore very simple.   One simply adds up\n\
# uniform deviates sampled from the rng, skipping lag samples in between\n\
# each rand used.  The mean of tsamples samples thus summed should be\n\
# 0.5*tsamples.  The standard deviation should be sqrt(tsamples/12).\n\
# The experimental values of the sum are thus converted into a\n\
# p-value (using the erf()) and a ks-test applied to psamples of them.\n\

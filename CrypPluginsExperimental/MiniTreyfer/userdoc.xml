    MiniTreyfer is the mini-version of Treyfer cipher with only 16-bit plaintext and 16-bit key. 
    It is primarily developed to automatically acquire a slid-pair for further use in the slide attacks.

  <usage lang="en">
    
    The MiniTreyfer works by first creating a random 16-bit key as a reference. This key is generated using random number generator.
    Then the plugin starts generating pairs of plaintext and ciphertext such that the plaintext is encrypted using Treyfer cipher into ciphertext bits.
    The plugin terminates when it finds a pair of plaintext-ciphertext that uses the previously generated key for encryption. This pair is nothing but a slid pair and is the output of the plugin.
